# Emotional Intelligence Notes

This repository contains my research, notes, and reflections on **Emotional Intelligence (EI)**—the books I’ve read, apps I’ve tested, and resources I’ve found most useful for developing EI in professional and personal life.

As a **control engineer and roboticist by training**, I’ve noticed strong parallels between EI frameworks and control theory:

* **Self-awareness** resembles *observers*—the better we observe a system, the better we can regulate it.
* **Self-regulation** mirrors *control laws*—a combination of observation and if–then rules.
* **Positive and negative emotional attractors** parallel nonlinear control and regions of attraction.
* **LQR/LQG controllers** echo adaptability and stability in the presence of noise.
* **Feedforward and feedback control** offer insights into planning, coaching, and mentoring.
* **Control of Networked systems and gain theory** remind us that our actions influence the stability of broader social systems.

These notes are the result of **deep reading, research, and self-reflection**. I’m sharing them in the spirit of *learning in public* and hope to build a **community of practice** where we can refine, expand, and apply these ideas together.

I’ve also included curated **apps, websites, and tools** that have supported my EI journey. Contributions, discussions, and new perspectives are welcome—let’s improve and learn together.
