# Emotional Intelligence Notes

This repository contains my research, notes, and reflections on **Emotional Intelligence (EI)**—the books I’ve read, apps I’ve tested, and resources I’ve found most useful for developing EI in professional and personal life.

As a **control engineer and roboticist by training**, I’ve noticed strong parallels between EI frameworks and control theory:

* **Self-awareness** resembles *observers*—the better we observe a system, the better we can regulate it.
* **Self-regulation** mirrors *control laws*—a combination of observation and if–then rules.
* **Positive and negative emotional attractors** parallel nonlinear control and regions of attraction.
* **LQR/LQG controllers** echo adaptability and stability in the presence of noise.
* **Feedforward and feedback control** offer insights into planning, coaching, and mentoring.
* **Control of Networked systems and gain theory** remind us that our actions influence the stability of broader social systems.

These notes are the result of **deep reading, research, and self-reflection**. I’m sharing them in the spirit of *learning in public* and hope to build a **community of practice** where we can refine, expand, and apply these ideas together.

I’ve also included curated **apps, websites, and tools** that have supported my EI journey. Contributions, discussions, and new perspectives are welcome—let’s improve and learn together.

To use this repository, begin with the overview of Emotional Intelligence (EI) and the Team Emotional Intelligence model (see links below). Each markdown file contains draft material developed using generative models and structured prompts, inspired by references I have studied. The structure of the files reflects my experimentation with different prompts and methods.

I am particularly fascinated by the neuroscience and psychology behind these principles, as they provide both a working model and evidence of why these skills matter—and how they shape our brain and behavior.

My long-term goal is to create coaching GPTs that help people practice and apply these techniques. I welcome collaboration and feedback to refine the material. You’ll also find references to books I’ve read, which provide additional context for understanding my perspective.
