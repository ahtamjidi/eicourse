### Teamwork
The Emotional and Social Intelligence competency of Teamwork means having the ability to work with others toward a shared goal, participating actively, sharing responsibility and rewards, and contributing to the capability of the team as a whole. This competency leads to greater effectiveness, open communication, and outcomes that are not only successful but can also be innovative and unexpected in positive ways. Along the way, teams build spirit, positive relationships, and a sense of pride and identity.

## Example (good): 
**Successful Software Team Example:**

In a leading software company, a highly effective software development team was tasked with delivering a key product upgrade within a tight deadline. They exemplified the principles of good teamwork as outlined in "Teams That Work" by Scott Tannenbaum and Eduardo Salas:

1. **Capability:** The team consisted of experienced developers with diverse skill sets, including knowledge of the latest programming languages and frameworks. They also had strong teamwork capabilities, allowing them to collaborate seamlessly.
    
2. **Communication:** The team communicated effectively through daily stand-up meetings and instant messaging channels. They shared critical information, discussed potential roadblocks, and ensured everyone was on the same page.
    
3. **Cognition:** The team possessed a shared understanding of the project's priorities, roles, and overall vision. They held regular strategy sessions to align their goals and ensure clarity throughout the project.
    
4. **Conditions:** The company provided ample resources, a supportive culture, and a flexible work environment that allowed the team to perform effectively. This positive work environment contributed to their success.
    
5. **Coordination:** The team exhibited excellent teamwork behaviors. They maintained situational awareness, provided backup and support to each other when needed, and adapted quickly to changing project requirements.
    
6. **Cooperation:** The team members had a strong sense of trust and psychological safety, allowing them to openly share ideas and provide constructive feedback. This cooperative environment fostered a high level of cohesion and collective efficacy.
    
7. **Coaching:** While the team had a designated leader, all members demonstrated leadership behaviors when necessary. They ensured clarity, encouraged participation, and removed obstacles collectively, which contributed to the team's success.
    

As a result of their effective teamwork, this software development team successfully delivered the key product upgrade ahead of schedule, meeting all quality standards and exceeding customer expectations.

## Example (bad): 


**Failed Software Team Example:**

In another software company, a software development team struggled to complete a critical project due to poor teamwork, in contrast to the principles outlined in "Teams That Work":

1. **Capability:** The team lacked the necessary mix of skills and expertise required for the project. Some team members had limited experience with the technology stack, causing inefficiencies and delays.
    
2. **Communication:** Communication within the team was fragmented and ineffective. Team members rarely shared important information, leading to misunderstandings and misalignment on project goals.
    
3. **Cognition:** The team members had conflicting views on project priorities and roles. They often disagreed on how to handle critical aspects of the project, causing frequent disruptions and confusion.
    
4. **Conditions:** The work environment was challenging, with limited resources and a culture that did not prioritize collaboration. This unfavorable context made it difficult for the team to perform effectively.
    
5. **Coordination:** Team members exhibited poor coordination, failing to maintain situational awareness or provide backup and support when needed. This lack of teamwork behaviors led to repeated setbacks.
    
6. **Cooperation:** Trust was lacking among team members, leading to a lack of psychological safety. They were hesitant to share ideas or feedback, and cohesion within the team was minimal.
    
7. **Coaching:** The team leader struggled to provide clear guidance and support, and there was a lack of leadership behaviors among team members. This contributed to the team's disarray.
    

As a result of these team-related issues, the software development project faced numerous delays, quality issues, and missed deadlines. Ultimately, the project was deemed a failure, and the company had to invest additional resources to rectify the situation.

===============================

### 2 Emotional Self control
Emotional Self-Control is the ability to keep disruptive emotions and impulses in check, and to maintain your effectiveness under stressful or even hostile conditions.

It's also something that can differentiate great leaders from those with whom it is difficult to work.

Instead of suppressing our emotions, we take notice of them as they emerge, mentally naming or noting them, along with any bodily signals that may accompany how we are feeling in the moment. Having Emotional Self-Control means staying clear-headed and calm, balancing one's impulses and feelings for the good of the group, or for the good of a given task, mission, or vision.

### prompt 3
CERQ assessment addresses the self-regulatory, conscious, and cognitive components of emotion regulation by distinguishing between nine different strategies: Self-blame – the causal attribution of negative events to oneself. Other-blame – the causal attribution of adverse events to others. Rumination – overthinking emotions and thoughts associated with negative events. Catastrophizing – explicitly emphasizing the consequences of negative events. Putting into perspective – relativizing a negative event by considering the impact over time. Positive refocusing – keeping attention on pleasant thoughts after the occurrence of negative events. Positive reappraisal – finding the silver lining by creating a positive meaning to negative events. Acceptance – accepting and not changing a negative situation or the emotions caused. Refocus – thinking about what steps to take and how to handle the negative event. Give specific tips and tools to improve my score in each category.

## notes
### SELF-MANAGEMENT

- **Consistency**: Stability/consistency is key to self-management. Constantly changing can cause others to question your beliefs and what you stand for and can also cause you to become confused about what you truly believe.
- **Stick to the plan**: Do it right and in a timely way. Plans are made for a reason. Stick to them but be flexible as necessary. The goal is set; it must be met.
- **Be accountable**: Things do not always work out as planned. That is normal, probably more normal than when they do work out. You have to be able to admit that and then use your flexibility to get things back on track. Flexibility is key; do not worry about it—move forward.
- **Educate yoursel**f: Once we stop learning, we stop living and growth stagnates. Do not let change pass you by; embrace it. Read, read, and read some more. Talk and listen to mentors and peers; look for different perspectives. Once we stop evolving, we will be behind the times.
- **Stay mentally and physically fi**t: This is a very important part of being able to practice the other aspects of self-management. Exercising your body is just as crucial to self-management as exercising your mind. A body that is not well rested, nutritionally fed, or physically exercised can lead to emotional and physical illnesses.

### SELF-REGULATION

- Ability to control one's emotions, desires, and behaviors in order to reach a positive outcome
- Art to finding the balance between expressing one's feelings and avoiding unnecessary tension

Self-Regulation is a direct reflection of the type of pressure one is experiencing. There is good and bad pressure:

1. **Good**: Result of an aggressive but nonharmful atmosphere. One views the people around them as an inspiration and uses this as motivation, which can lead to the acquisition of self-regulation.
2. **Bad**: When the atmosphere is critical and harmful. This pressure does not motivate and self-regulation is lost.

### 1 Emotional Self awareness
Emotional Self-Awareness is the capacity to tune into your own feelings, sense inner signals, and recognize how your feelings affect you and your performance. It is an important skill for leadership at any level, as well as many aspects of life.

The purpose of developing Emotional Self-Awareness is that it allows us to understand how our bodily sensations and our emotions impact ourselves, others, and our environment. Each moment is an opportunity to be self-aware. Thus, the more we practice it, the more proficient we become and the greater our capacity to recognize the space between stimuli and our response to that stimuli, ensuring a more conscious and skillful approach.

Without Emotional Self-Awareness, it is difficult to become proficient in and consistently use the other Emotional and Social Intelligence Competencies.

## tools


There are several assessments available for measuring self-awareness, each with its own approach and focus. Here are some well-known self-awareness assessments, along with references and a brief comparison and contrast of their features:

1. **Emotional Intelligence Appraisal (EQ 2.0):**
    
    - **Reference:** This assessment is based on the work of Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves, as presented in their book "Emotional Intelligence 2.0."
    - **Focus:** It primarily measures emotional intelligence, including self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management.
    - **Format:** The EQ 2.0 assessment provides a self-report questionnaire with a focus on 66 specific emotional intelligence skills.
    - **Scoring:** Scores are provided for overall emotional intelligence as well as individual sub-scales, including self-awareness.
    - **Use:** It's widely used in organizational settings for personal development and leadership training.
2. **Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI):**
    
    - **Reference:** The MBTI was developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers, based on Carl Jung's theories.
    - **Focus:** It assesses personality type, including preferences for how individuals perceive and interact with the world.
    - **Format:** The MBTI categorizes individuals into one of 16 personality types based on preferences for four dichotomies (e.g., Introversion vs. Extraversion).
    - **Scoring:** Participants receive a four-letter type code (e.g., INFP) based on their responses.
    - **Use:** It's commonly used in organizational and career counseling settings for personal and team development.
3. **Mindfulness Self-Reflection Questionnaire (MSRQ):**
    
    - **Reference:** Developed by William D. Britton and Sara W. Lazar, this assessment is focused on measuring mindfulness and self-reflection.
    - **Focus:** It assesses an individual's level of mindfulness and their ability to reflect on their inner experiences.
    - **Format:** The MSRQ includes items related to attention, awareness, and self-reflection.
    - **Scoring:** Scores are generated based on participants' responses, reflecting their mindfulness and self-reflection tendencies.
    - **Use:** It's used in psychology research and mindfulness programs to measure mindfulness and self-awareness.
4. **The Johari Window:**
    
    - **Reference:** Developed by Joseph Luft and Harry Ingham in the 1950s.
    - **Focus:** It is a framework rather than a formal assessment, designed to help individuals understand themselves better through feedback from others and self-disclosure.
    - **Format:** The Johari Window divides information about oneself into four quadrants: Open (known to self and others), Blind (known to others but not to self), Hidden (known to self but not to others), and Unknown (neither known to self nor others).
    - **Scoring:** There are no specific scores; instead, it's a tool for increasing self-awareness through interpersonal communication.
    - **Use:** It's used in various interpersonal and team development contexts.
5. **Self-Reflective Journaling:**
    
    - **Reference:** Not associated with a specific assessment tool but a self-guided practice.
    - **Focus:** Self-reflective journaling involves individuals writing down their thoughts, feelings, and experiences as a means of gaining self-awareness.
    - **Format:** It is a free-form, open-ended practice that individuals can do regularly.
    - **Scoring:** There are no scores; instead, it's a self-improvement practice that fosters self-awareness through introspection.
    - **Use:** It's a flexible and personal approach to self-awareness development.

In summary, these assessments and tools vary in their focus, format, and purpose. EQ 2.0 and MBTI are structured assessments with predefined categories and scores, while the MSRQ and the Johari Window are more open-ended and often used for self-reflection and interpersonal awareness. Self-reflective journaling is a self-directed practice that can be used alongside formal assessments to enhance self-awareness. The choice of assessment depends on the specific goals and preferences of the individual or organization seeking to measure self-awareness.

### 3 Adaptability
Adaptability is an Emotional and Social Intelligence Leadership Competency that entails having the flexibility to handle change, balance multiple demands, and adapt to new situations with fresh ideas.

An adaptable leader can meet challenges as they arise and adjust strategy or style based on what is needed most. They are not halted by sudden change, remaining comfortable with the uncertainty that leadership can bring.

While adaptability involves changing to manage under new conditions, resilience, through 'bouncing back', implies the ability to revert to a previous, more positive state, after experiencing some difficulty or challenge. This is what, by definition, separates adaptability from resilience. (Ref [Resilience v adaptability - InnerDrive Blogs](https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/resilience-v-adaptability#:~:text=While%20adaptability%20involves%20changing%20to,definition%2C%20separates%20adaptability%20from%20resilience.)


What is the relationship between resilience and adaptability?

Adaptability implies a sense of personal choice, of purposefully navigating—rather than being driven by—changing circumstances. Resilience is the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties. Resilience gives you the ability to bounce forward with new insights and learning you can carry into the future.

Scenario 1: Success of a Software Product Due to Adaptability

Imagine a software development team working on a new application for a rapidly changing market. The team is led by an adaptable project manager who recognizes the importance of staying flexible in the face of evolving user needs and market trends. Here's how adaptability leads to the success of the software product:

**Key Factors:**

1. **Market Shifts:** The software market experiences rapid changes with new competitors and technologies emerging frequently.
    
2. **User Feedback:** Users provide valuable feedback, and their requirements often change as they use the product.
    
3. **Team Collaboration:** The development team promotes open communication and collaboration, encouraging team members to share innovative ideas and adapt to evolving circumstances.
    

**Adaptability in Action:**

- The project manager encourages regular meetings to gather user feedback and assess market changes.
    
- The team uses agile development methodologies, allowing them to quickly adjust the product roadmap and prioritize features based on user demand.
    
- When a new technology trend emerges, the team conducts research and integrates relevant features into the software.
    
- The project manager keeps the team motivated and focused by emphasizing the importance of adaptability and the benefits it brings to the product's success.

Scenario 2: Failure of a Software Product Due to Lack of Adaptability

Now, let's consider a scenario where a software product fails due to a lack of adaptability within the development team and leadership.

**Key Factors:**

1. **Resistance to Change:** The team and leadership are resistant to making adjustments to the product, believing that the initial plan is foolproof.
    
2. **Ignored User Feedback:** User feedback pointing out flaws and needed improvements is ignored, leading to a stagnant product.
    
3. **Competitive Disruption:** New competitors enter the market with innovative features that quickly outpace the stagnant product.
    

**Lack of Adaptability in Action:**

- The project manager dismisses user feedback as minor issues and insists on following the initial project plan.
    
- The team does not consider integrating new technologies or features, even when they become industry standards.
    
- As the competition gains ground, the team and leadership remain complacent, assuming their product will continue to succeed.
    
- The lack of adaptability leads to a declining user base and ultimately the failure of the software product.
    

**Tools and Tips for Improvement:**

For Individual Contributors:

- **Books:** "Mindset: The New Psychology of Success" by Carol S. Dweck helps individuals develop a growth mindset, which is crucial for adaptability.

What team emotional intelligence norms play an important role in team adaptability? Give references to back up your claim

ChatGPT

Team emotional intelligence norms play a crucial role in fostering team adaptability. Emotional intelligence within a team involves recognizing and managing emotions effectively to enhance teamwork, communication, and decision-making. Here are some key team emotional intelligence norms that are particularly important for team adaptability, along with references to support these claims:

1. **Open Communication and Trust**: Teams with open and trusting communication norms create an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their ideas, concerns, and feedback. This transparency allows for quicker adaptation to changing circumstances and the incorporation of diverse perspectives into decision-making.
    
    _Reference_: Lopes, P. N., Salovey, P., & Straus, R. (2003). Emotional intelligence, personality, and the perceived quality of social relationships. Personality and Individual Differences, 35(3), 641-658.
    
2. **Empathy and Understanding**: Team members who practice empathy and understanding norms are better at recognizing and responding to the emotions and needs of others. This helps in building stronger relationships, resolving conflicts, and adapting to changes collaboratively.
    
    _Reference_: Goleman, D. (2006). Social intelligence: The new science of human relationships. Bantam.
    
3. **Flexibility and Resilience**: Teams that embrace flexibility and resilience norms are better equipped to handle setbacks and adapt to unexpected challenges. They view failures as opportunities to learn and grow, which is essential for adaptability.
    
    _Reference_: Tugade, M. M., & Fredrickson, B. L. (2004). Resilient individuals use positive emotions to bounce back from negative emotional experiences. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 86(2), 320-333.
    
4. **Conflict Resolution Skills**: Teams that develop norms for constructive conflict resolution can address differences of opinion effectively. This ensures that conflicts do not hinder adaptability but rather contribute to better decision-making.
    
    _Reference_: Rahim, M. A. (2002). Toward a theory of managing organizational conflict. The International Journal of Conflict Management, 13(3), 206-235.
    
5. **Emotional Regulation**: Teams that promote emotional regulation norms encourage members to manage their emotions in high-pressure situations. This prevents emotional outbursts and allows for more rational decision-making during times of change.
    
    _Reference_: Gross, J. J. (2015). Emotion regulation: Current status and future prospects. Psychological Inquiry, 26(1), 1-26.
    
6. **Shared Vision and Goals**: Teams with shared vision and goal-setting norms are more likely to adapt to changing circumstances because they have a clear sense of purpose. This shared purpose guides their adaptability efforts toward a common objective.
    
    _Reference_: Locke, E. A., & Latham, G. P. (2006). New directions in goal-setting theory. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 15(5), 265-268.
    
7. **Feedback and Learning Culture**: Teams that establish norms for providing and receiving feedback create a culture of continuous learning. This culture allows teams to adapt by identifying areas for improvement and making necessary adjustments.
    
    _Reference_: Edmondson, A. C. (2019). The fearless organization: Creating psychological safety in the workplace for learning, innovation, and growth. John Wiley & Sons.

Late at night, in a dimly-lit bar, a trio of jazz musicians takes the stage. 

At first, you recognize the song. But then the musicians take a turn, launching into an improvised version of the tune. It sounds chaotic but beautiful — the mastery of their instruments on full display. 

The magic of jazz music is in its unpredictability. What seems like chaos to the casual observer is actually a masterclass in improvisation and adaptability. Each musician reacts to the other, none of them certain where they’ll go next.

Adaptation is essential in the modern workplace. These days, industries turn on a dime, with numerous externalities affecting an organization’s work. 

The COVID-19 pandemic reminded everyone of this fact. Almost overnight, entire companies started working from home, struggled with supply chain issues, and reassured clients that productivity won’t be affected.

And as governments tweaked their pandemic restrictions, organizations continued to pivot in response. It’s no wonder “resilience” was one of the [top 14 skills HR employers looked for in 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2021/05/20/hr-leaders-share-14-in-demand-skills-employers-want-in-2021/?sh=7f43fc341e45).

3. **Increased innovation.** A resilient team is a creative team, which is great for generating innovative ideas.
4. **Quick mobilization.** Adaptable teams are quick to spring into action, no matter the situation.
5. **Faster decisions.** When people know how to adapt together, they can quickly make decisions. This allows them to outflank the competition.
6. **Increased initiative.** Adaptable people are natural go-getters. They know where they’re needed and start working without being asked.

### How to improve adaptability in the workplace ###

If you’re a hiring manager, you already know the value of flexibility in your work environment. Here are some tips on how to increase this vital resource:

1. **Hire people with adaptable traits.** Look for people who have the skills and attributes listed above. Not only will they be adaptable, but they can help your current employees be adaptable, too. (Bonus points if “adaptability” is one of their skills.)
2. **Offer adaptability training.** Many virtual or in-person seminars can help improve employees’ adaptation skills. Start your research by looking at services like BetterUp and LinkedIn Learning.
3. **Institute an** [**open-door policy**](https://www.betterup.com/blog/what-is-the-open-door-policy)**.** This allows employees to come to you with feedback during organizational changes. This kind of information is vital to helping you adapt.
4. **Communicate the changes clearly.** Use town hall meetings, video conferences, and organization-wide emails to explain the “why” behind company transitions.
5. **Lead by example.** Change starts at the top. If you’re adaptable, your employees will be, too.

#### How to measure adaptability in the workplace ####

If you want to know whether you’ve succeeded, you’ll need some kind of [feedback mechanism](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-ask-for-and-receive-feedback). Here are some tools to consider:

* Send out an anonymous survey
* Track the number of errors that occur when employees are confronted with change
* Check-in with team leaders to see how they’re doing

There’s also a qualitative element to measuring adaptation — you’ll just know it when you see it. Here are some successful examples of adaptability, so you can identify it in your own team.

* Your clients are reporting bugs in your company’s software. Your coding team sprang into action to fix the problem right away. They told you after they’d solved the problem.
* A low-level employee noticed a typo on the company website. They flagged it to their superior, who fixed it within the day.
* There’s a topic trending on social media that’s related to your company. Your communications team seizes the opportunity to promote your product and adjusts their production schedule accordingly.

### How to improve situational adaptability in other areas of your life ###

There are many everyday opportunities to train your resilience. Here are some small things you can do to work out your flexibility:

1. **Seek out new experiences and opportunities to** [**keep learning**](https://www.betterup.com/blog/why-learning-how-to-learn-and-unlearn-is-the-new-competitive-advantage)**.** Take a class. Go on a trip. Watch a TED Talk. Every new experience will teach you how to react in different situations.
2. **Practice** [**self-awareness**](https://www.betterup.com/blog/what-is-self-awareness) **to understand how you react in different contexts.** When you’re stressed, angry, tired, happy, hungry, or relaxed, you are a different person. Knowing yourself will help you control your behavior, regardless of your mental and physical state.
3. **Find solutions to even the smallest problems.** Is the sink leaking? Look up a video and learn how to fix it. Don’t have space for your new bike? Rearrange things to make it fit. These small tasks help you flex your problem-solving muscles.
4. **Learn when to ignore the small stuff.** Some things simply don’t deserve your attention or frustration. A spilled cup of water doesn’t need the same emotional energy as a personal crisis.

Your team lead calls a meeting to let you all know they’re changing the normal workflow. Instead of only running your work by the product department, you must also gain the marketing team’s approval. You want to offer a better cadence but they already approved and implemented the new approval process. 

Sudden workflow changes like this can send you out of [your comfort zone](https://www.betterup.com/blog/comfort-zone). You must decide whether to embrace this change with positivity and go with the flow or dig your heels in, stick to the old way, and retreat in the face of a new challenge.

But this second option isn’t viable in most work situations as you’ll slow down everyone’s workflow and impede your [professional development](https://www.betterup.com/blog/professional-development). Instead, you can foster several types of adaptability skills to take on any process change or challenge that comes your way.

What are adaptability skills?
----------

[Adaptability skills](https://www.betterup.com/blog/what-are-adaptability-skills) are proficiencies you can use to adjust to new situations and change your actions as needed. This involves privileging strategic thinking and being open-minded when encountering obstacles.

[Constructive criticism](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-give-and-receive-constructive-criticism-at-work), unexpected changes, and worst-case scenarios happen in any work environment. That's why adaptability skills are important. They aid your [decision-making](https://www.betterup.com/blog/decision-making-process-in-management) and help you decide [how to set goals](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-set-goals-and-achieve-them). If you’re adaptable, you can continue moving forward instead of dwelling on the issues you face.

While both are equally valuable, adaptability differs from flexibility because it demands new circumstances. Working later or accommodating team members suggests flexibility and openness to adjust. But adapting means you’re facing a unique situation, no matter how prepared you are.

[<img alt="New call-to-action" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/9253440/dddaca63-ecfe-441f-b3ea-60f0dea4d84c.png" height="300" width="1800" />](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/9253440/dddaca63-ecfe-441f-b3ea-60f0dea4d84c)

7 types of adaptability skills
----------

[Adaptability skills](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-increase-adaptability) are often either cognitive, personality-based, or emotional.

Cognitive adaptability involves processing new information and adjusting your thinking accordingly. This adaptability type draws on [your ability to learn](https://www.betterup.com/blog/why-learning-how-to-learn-and-unlearn-is-the-new-competitive-advantage), [curiosity](https://www.betterup.com/blog/intellectual-curiosity), and open-mindedness.

Personality-based adaptability means seeing a situation for what it is and adapting your behavior to respond accordingly. This relies on resourcefulness, [communication](https://www.betterup.com/blog/effective-strategies-to-improve-your-communication-skills), and [teamwork skills](https://www.betterup.com/blog/teamwork-skills), and is helpful in the workplace.

Emotional adaptability focuses on acknowledging, accepting, and moving past changes, which draws on [your resilience](https://grow.betterup.com/resources/resilience-in-an-age-of-uncertainty).  

Let’s dive deeper into the adaptability skills you can cultivate to improve your work performance.

### 1. Curiosity ###

Curiosity fosters open-mindedness and a [growth mindset](https://www.betterup.com/blog/growth-mindset). With an inquisitive spirit, you’re more likely to embrace new situations and view challenges as opportunities for growth and exploration. You’ll approach tasks with curiosity to develop your skills and promote [innovative thinking](https://www.betterup.com/blog/types-of-innovation) in your workplace.

Here are a few related skills that enhance your curiosity:

### 2. Learning ###

Whether you [learn independently](https://www.betterup.com/blog/self-directed-learning) or [through collaboration](https://www.betterup.com/blog/breaking-down-silos), the ability to [learn new things](https://www.betterup.com/blog/learn-something-new) means you quickly acquire and retain knowledge, skills, and perspectives that help you adapt to new situations.

<img alt="Two-colleagues-talking-at-work-types-of-adaptability-skills" src="https://www.betterup.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Two-colleagues-talking-at-work.jpg?width=2119&name=Two-colleagues-talking-at-work.jpg" width="2119" />

A few skills related to your ability to learn include:

* Critical thinking: Effective learning habits rely on [critical thinking skills](https://www.betterup.com/blog/critical-thinking-skills), including analyzing information, evaluating arguments, and [making informed decisions](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-make-better-decisions).

* **Continuous learning:** When you make a deliberate effort to continuously learn, you actively seek out new experiences and information, creating a feedback loop of development.

* Feedback acceptance:[Being more receptive to feedback](https://www.betterup.com/blog/receptive-to-feedback) improves your ability to learn as you’ll transform potential problems into possibilities for growth.

### 3. Resourcefulness ###

Resourcefulness refers to the ability to effectively solve problems and find solutions in the face of challenges or limited resources when working toward team or [personal goals](https://www.betterup.com/blog/personal-goals?hsLang=en).

This requires creativity and innovation to develop unique and effective solutions and is particularly valuable in the workplace, as it allows individuals to navigate and overcome obstacles, even when resources are scarce.

Show resourcefulness by drawing upon the following skills:

* Creative thinking: Come up with original ideas to approach problems from a fresh perspective.

* Problem-solving: Identify, analyze, and resolve problems systematically and effectively. 

* Budgeting:[Take the initiative](https://www.betterup.com/blog/taking-initiative) to set and stay within a budget to demonstrate you’re aware of a new challenge’s constraints and are stepping up to meet them with the resources at hand.

### 4. Communication skills ###

[Communication skills](https://www.betterup.com/blog/why-communication-is-key-to-workplace-and-how-to-improve-skills?hsLang=en) like [being a good listener](https://www.betterup.com/blog/the-importance-of-listening-as-a-leader-in-the-digital-era) and understanding [nonverbal signals](https://www.betterup.com/blog/types-of-nonverbal-communication) enable you to [build stronger relationships](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-build-rapport) and effectively navigate complex and ever-changing situations. 

[Upskill](https://www.betterup.com/blog/upskilling) the following items to strengthen your communication skills:

* Emotional intelligence:[Recognize and manage your emotions](https://www.betterup.com/blog/4-ways-to-improve-emotional-intelligence-within-your-team) and others’ to communicate effectively [and empathize](https://www.betterup.com/blog/empathy-vs-sympathy) with your team.
* Active listening:[This involves](https://www.betterup.com/blog/types-of-listening?hsLang=en) paying attention and being present when others speak to understand what they’re saying instead of focusing on when you can interject.
* Nonverbal communication: Good communication skills don’t stop at listening and speaking. Understanding nonverbal cues like [gestures](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-read-body-language), facial expressions, and posture helps you pick up on how a person truly feels.

<img alt="Positive-woman-smiling-during-meeting-types-of-adaptability-skills" src="https://www.betterup.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Positive-woman-smiling-during-meeting.jpg?width=2120&name=Positive-woman-smiling-during-meeting.jpg" width="2120" />

### 5. Organizational skills ###

[Being organized](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-improve-attention-to-detail) ensures you know what resources are available to you, whether personal contacts, time, or energy. [Organizational skills](https://www.betterup.com/blog/organizational-skills) also help you determine what's necessary to achieve your goals or finish your work. 

Key related skills include:

* Project management: Manage your tasks to balance your workload by breaking larger items into less overwhelming ones and creating checklists to monitor progress.

* Time management: Keep tabs on how much time you take to complete tasks so you can adapt to changing project schedules and due dates.

### 6. Teamwork skills ###

When you [work as a team](https://www.betterup.com/blog/what-is-teamwork?hs_preview=IHCEwJnL-69849893539&hsLang=en), personality types and opinions might clash. But that won’t matter if everyone sees the value of having [diverse people and perspectives](https://www.betterup.com/blog/what-diversity-really-means-and-why-its-crucial-in-the-workplace) at work. [Conflict may occur](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-handle-conflicts-in-the-office), but you’ll be able to adapt and address the situation well thanks to your teamwork skills.

Here are a few of the best ones to foster:

* Leadership skills:[Adaptable leaders](https://www.betterup.com/blog/adaptive-leadership) inspire others to thrive under pressure and effectively collaborate to solve complex issues.

* **Compromise:** You’re working with your team to achieve a common goal — don’t lose sight of that. Teamwork requires a willingness to compromise and understanding how to set aside your preferences for the greater good.

* **Conflict resolution:** This draws upon your communication skills to manage and resolve conflicts within a team. Use this skill to find common ground and remind everyone of overarching objectives. 

### 7. Resilience ###

[Resilience](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-build-resilience-why-resilience-is-a-top-skill-for-the-workplace) allows you to address obstacles straight-on. You’ll bounce back from setbacks, adapt quickly to change, and persevere through tough times. 

Here are three related skills that’ll [improve your resilience](https://www.betterup.com/blog/recipe-for-resilience-five-key-ingredients):

* Self-confidence: Having [a strong sense of self-esteem](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-improve-self-esteem) and belief in your abilities will help you take on challenges, persist through difficulties, and learn from your experiences.

* Determination:[Maintaining a solid resolve](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-improve-self-determination) will help you [stay motivated](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-stay-motivated) and accomplish more goals.

* **Diligence:** Apply consistent effort and attention to your responsibilities to ensure you steadily move toward success.

<img alt="Manager-and-team-meeting-in-conference-room-types-of-adaptability-skills" src="https://www.betterup.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Manager-and-team-meeting-in-conference-room.jpg?width=2120&name=Manager-and-team-meeting-in-conference-room.jpg" width="2120" />  

How to know if you’re an adaptable employee
----------

While there’s always room for improvement, you might already use many of the skills listed above. Here are five signs you're an adaptable person:

1. You're present: Rather than dwell on the past or worry too much about the future, you [put mindfulness to the test](https://www.betterup.com/blog/mindfulness-vs-meditation) and embrace change as it happens.

2. You use positive self-talk: You use [positive thinking](https://www.betterup.com/blog/self-talk) like “I can do this with a little hard work” rather than thoughts of [self-doubt](https://www.betterup.com/blog/overcoming-self-doubt) to motivate you.

3. **You see the bigger picture:** When challenges arise, you quickly remember your overall objectives so you don’t feel discouraged or distracted. 

4. **You like to experiment:** Doing things the same way forever doesn't level you up and gets boring. Instead, you look for new ways of doing your work and learn something in the process.

5. You exhibit empathy: You’re an understanding individual who recognizes the importance of emotional and [cognitive empathy](https://www.betterup.com/blog/cognitive-empathy) when responding to teammates as they react to challenging situations.

How to teach adaptability
----------

If you hold a leadership role, it’s advantageous for you to teach adaptability skills to your coworkers. Here are a few ways you can do so: 

* [Have them visualize](https://www.betterup.com/blog/visualization?hsLang=en) one thing they could be more adaptable about professionally

* Give them a tour of all the resources they have access to

* Hold monthly seminars where you practice problem-solving challenges together

* Create a board (virtual or physical) where you share new findings or exciting information regarding adaptability or team member progress

* Set up specific, organized lines of communication, like Slack channels called #questions, for them to use

The importance of adaptability for mental health
----------

Adaptability is essential for your [mental health](https://www.betterup.com/blog/its-time-for-a-complete-reframe-on-mental-health), no matter your occupation. Students, teachers, and [professional athletes all face similar struggles](https://www.betterup.com/blog/mental-health-in-athletes?hsLang=en), like change and uncertainty.

But if you’re more rigid in your thinking, new and scary situations might throw you off kilter, and you won’t feel prepared and supported to address them. 

<img alt="Concentrated-woman-reading-book-types-of-adaptability-skills" src="https://www.betterup.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Concentrated-woman-reading-book.jpg?width=2121&name=Concentrated-woman-reading-book.jpg" width="2121" />

[One study found that life satisfaction, the ability to adapt, and one’s support system are all connected](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4963457/#:~:text=A%20longitudinal%20study%20showed%20that,adaptability%20indirectly%20predicted%20life%20satisfaction). People adapted better to change with a solid social support system to help them. As these participants’ environments changed and new things came their way, they could adapt easier. 

With resources and help at your fingertips — like easily accessible communication platforms and a helpful manager — you’ll feel confident and willing to embrace change and combat the [stress](https://www.betterup.com/blog/types-of-stress) and [anxiety](https://www.betterup.com/blog/anxiety) it might bring with it. 

Patience and adaptability will get you closer to your goals
----------

Fostering adaptability is all about practice. The next time a challenge arises or a change surprises you, consider the types of adaptability skills you can employ — like positive thinking and communication skills — to effectively address this situation.

Every time you do so, you’re strengthening these skills and making them habitual.

Eventually, you won’t need to think about how to approach a situation that puts you out of your comfort zone — you’ll have adaptability locked in.

[<img alt="New call-to-action" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/9253440/24fd5d8d-374f-4b40-ae4f-fc0817d6e4fc.png" height="750" width="1800" />](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/9253440/24fd5d8d-374f-4b40-ae4f-fc0817d6e4fc))

Coaching new school principals, I have come to appreciate the hidden emotional costs to leadership promotion. If I don’t support my leaders to adapt emotionally to their new roles, they are more likely to hit a wall when adapting to the skills of their new job.

Consider Janet. As an assistant principal, she turns every task into gold because of her work ethic, intelligence, instructional expertise, and organizational skills. She earns considerable credibility with her team, and so is a no-brainer successor when her principal decides to move on.

Six months later, Janet is struggling. She works extremely hard and everyone appreciates her level of commitment, but the school is not humming. She is both angered and confused by a growing resistance to the student culture system among the upper grade teachers, and blames the teachers when student discipline begins to slip. There is dissension among the leadership team on how to manage these challenges. She is surprised by what she sees as the weakness of many of her team members, and so finds it easier to take on student challenges herself. And yet, for the first time, she is missing deadlines and dropping balls. How can she get to the adult issues when student challenges take up so much of her time?

I see multiple entry points to coaching Janet, but most will treat the symptoms rather than the disease. If I choose to attack technical skills such as meeting facilitation, difficult conversations or even personal organization, I miss the fact that Janet has failed to adapt to her new position at an emotional level.

**Adapting Starts with Self-Awareness**

Because leaders like Janet begin a perpetual sprint from the moment they are offered their new job, few take the time to ground themselves emotionally in what is happening to them. William Bridge’s _Transitions_ (1980) is an excellent place to start building [Emotional Self-Awareness](https://www.keystepmedia.com/mindful-self-awareness-leadership-research) because it emphasizes that all change processes””no matter how positive””begin with endings and loss. Janet and I begin our work by reading chapter one and talking about endings. I ask her some combination of these questions:

_Even when transitions are positive ones, there’s loss. How does Bridge’s theory of endings help you make sense of your principal transition experience so far? What have you lost or had to let go of already? How do you think this has affected you emotionally? To what extent have you been able to let go? What do you think is getting in your way?_

Once Janet gets the idea about letting go, she needs help identifying the kinds of things that will get in her way if she doesn’t let go. Charan’s _The Leadership Pipeline_ (2000) is a great place to start. I connect our endings conversation to exploring what’s getting in the way with this quote:

_The highest-performing people, especially, are reluctant to change; they want to keep doing the activities that made them successful. As a result, people make the job transition from individual contributor to manager without making a behavioral or value-based transition. In effect, they become managers without accepting the requirements._

Chapter one offers concrete behaviors and values that get in the way of leaders adapting to new stages of leadership. Janet begins to see how her strength as a “doer” is holding her back from leading through others. My job at this point is to help Janet become aware of the values connected to her work up to this point, and then support her to make a conscious choice to shift them. Even when the choice is made, it takes time to unpack the habits, relationships, loyalties, and even character traits that are all pieces of Janet’s former strength.

**Self Managing Through the Micro-Moments**

Janet will confront countless micro-moments of challenge that are in fact opportunities to shift her deeply ingrained behaviors. Tomorrow she will be drawn to a challenging teacher-student interaction as she walks down the hallway. She can choose to jump in and solve the problem, call the behavioral support staff whose job it is to support teachers, or let the teacher manage his own challenge. Being aware””of the choice and of the emotions and values at play””is the first step. Then, Janet needs some strategies to help her choose new behaviors.

At this point, Janet and I do some aspirational thinking. I learned from [Boyatzis’s Intentional Change Model](https://www.keystepmedia.com/intentional-change-theory) (2006) that exploring the ideal opens Janet’s mind to possibilities that will likely yield effective self-management strategies. As we focus on a specific micro-moment””reactively or proactively””I say to her:

_Imagine at this moment that you are able to lead masterfully through others. How would you get yourself to do it? You see that teacher struggling with that student! What do you do with your emotions and desire to jump in? What do you think or do that keeps you from engaging?_

Deeply exploring this moment of opportunity allows Janet to identify some things she can do to manage her emotions and her old values and habits, and leverage new ones. She articulates a reminder that her inner coach will chant (“Remember, you are the only person that can lead this school. How many other people can do this work right now?”). She practices taking two deep breaths to ground herself in the moment. She makes a plan to engage her trusted assistant principal as an accountability partner. Janet keeps these strategies on a note-card that she tapes to the back of her iPad. We reflect on application over time, revising strategies as we learn what works, until Janet is consistently making strong choices about the work that she takes on or delegates to other staff.

Slowing your new leader down to reflect on endings, loss and surrendering strengths that no longer serve them is worth it. This coaching will save you weeks or months in new skill acquisition.

## Example

**Positive Outlook in the Tech Industry:**

**Example 1: Successful Product Delivery with Positive Outlook** In a tech startup, a project manager named Sarah exemplifies Positive Outlook. She is leading a team tasked with developing a cutting-edge mobile application with a tight deadline. Despite facing numerous technical challenges and resource constraints, Sarah maintains an unwaveringly positive outlook throughout the project.

Sarah consistently emphasizes the strengths of her team members, highlighting their past successes and talents. She encourages open communication, allowing team members to share concerns and ideas freely. When setbacks occur, Sarah reframes them as opportunities for learning and improvement, rather than dwelling on the negative aspects.

Her Positive Outlook inspires the team, fostering a collaborative and innovative atmosphere. Team members feel motivated and resilient in the face of adversity. Sarah's leadership and optimism help the team successfully deliver the product on time, exceeding client expectations.

**Example 2: Hindered Progress Due to Lack of Positive Outlook** In a different tech company, a software development team led by Alex faces a challenging project. However, Alex lacks a Positive Outlook and often dwells on the difficulties and uncertainties ahead. He frequently expresses doubts about the team's capabilities and the project's feasibility.

Alex's negative outlook affects team morale and motivation. Team members become demotivated and disengaged, leading to decreased productivity and missed deadlines. Alex's constant focus on the challenges makes it difficult for the team to overcome obstacles effectively.

As the project progresses, it becomes clear that the lack of a Positive Outlook is hindering progress. The project encounters significant delays, and key team members resign due to frustration and pessimism. The project ultimately fails to meet its objectives.

**Tips for Improving Positive Outlook:**

**For Individual Contributors:**

1. **Practice Gratitude:** Take time to reflect on the positive aspects of your work and personal life. Acknowledge your achievements, even the small ones, and express gratitude for them.
    
2. **Mindfulness Meditation:** Incorporate mindfulness practices into your daily routine to stay present and reduce negative thinking patterns. Apps like Headspace and Insight Timer offer guided meditation sessions.
    
3. **Optimistic Language:** Use positive and constructive language when discussing challenges or setbacks. Instead of saying "This is impossible," try saying "This is a difficult but solvable problem."
    
4. **Resilience Building:** Develop resilience by viewing failures as opportunities for growth. Learn from mistakes and setbacks rather than dwelling on them.
    
5. **Seek Positive Role Models:** Identify colleagues or mentors who exhibit a Positive Outlook and observe how they approach challenges. Learn from their mindset and behavior.
    

**For Managers/Leaders:**

1. **Lead by Example:** Demonstrate a Positive Outlook in your leadership style. Emphasize the strengths and potential of your team members and projects.
    
2. **Encourage Feedback:** Create an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and concerns openly. Address challenges collaboratively and positively.
    
3. **Provide Training:** Offer workshops or training sessions on emotional intelligence and resilience for your team members to enhance their Positive Outlook.
    
4. **Celebrate Achievements:** Recognize and celebrate milestones and achievements, both individual and team-based. Highlight the positive impact of the team's efforts.
    
5. **Foster a Growth Mindset:** Encourage a growth mindset culture where mistakes are viewed as opportunities for improvement, and challenges are seen as stepping stones to success.
    

**Recommended Books and Podcasts:**

- **Book:** "The Power of Positive Thinking" by Norman Vincent Peale: This classic book explores the benefits of adopting a positive mindset and provides practical techniques for doing so.
    
- **Book:** "Mindset: The New Psychology of Success" by Carol S. Dweck: While not solely focused on positive outlook, this book delves into the concept of a growth mindset, which is closely related to maintaining a positive perspective.
    
- **Podcast:** "The Happiness Lab" by Dr. Laurie Santos: This podcast explores the science of happiness and offers insights into how individuals can cultivate a positive outlook on life.
    
- **Podcast:** "The Tony Robbins Podcast" by Tony Robbins: Tony Robbins interviews experts and thought leaders on various topics, including personal development and maintaining a positive mindset.
    

By improving their Positive Outlook, both individual contributors and leaders in the tech industry can create a more resilient and innovative work environment, leading to better outcomes and higher job satisfaction.


Certainly, the ABCDE method, based on Seligman's cognitive theory, can be applied in an engineering team to improve performance by addressing cognitive and emotional factors. Here are two realistic scenarios where the method can be successfully used:

**Scenario 1: Meeting a Challenging Deadline**

_Adversity (A):_ The engineering team is tasked with delivering a critical project ahead of schedule due to unforeseen changes in client requirements.

_Belief (B):_ Some team members initially believe that meeting the new deadline is impossible given the complexity of the project. They feel overwhelmed and stressed, doubting their abilities to complete it on time.

_Consequence (C):_ The negative beliefs and stress result in reduced productivity, increased tension among team members, and a sense of hopelessness. It is unlikely the project will be delivered on time.

_Dispute (D):_ The team leader recognizes the need for a cognitive shift. They conduct a team meeting to discuss the situation openly. They emphasize that while the new deadline is challenging, the team has the skills and knowledge to overcome it. They encourage team members to dispute their negative beliefs and focus on finding innovative solutions.

_Energizing (E):_ The team, now with a more positive outlook, starts brainstorming and collaborating effectively. They identify areas where they can streamline the project, delegate tasks, and leverage each member's strengths. This newfound optimism and teamwork lead to a successful project delivery ahead of the revised deadline.

**Scenario 2: Handling Technical Failure**

_Adversity (A):_ The engineering team faces a critical technical failure in a project they've been working on for months. The failure not only threatens the project's success but also puts the team's reputation at risk.

_Belief (B):_ Initially, team members are demoralized and believe that this technical failure is a catastrophic setback. They fear client dissatisfaction and possible job insecurity.

_Consequence (C):_ The negative beliefs lead to a decrease in motivation and enthusiasm. The team becomes hesitant to address the problem, and progress stalls.

_Dispute (D):_ The team leader calls a meeting to reframe the situation. They encourage team members to dispute their initial beliefs and view the failure as an opportunity to learn and improve. They stress that the team can find a solution by leveraging their expertise.

_Energizing (E):_ With the renewed perspective, the team focuses on investigating the technical failure. They collaborate to identify the root cause and develop innovative solutions. As they make progress, the team's confidence grows. They not only resolve the technical issue but also enhance the project's overall quality. The team learns valuable lessons from the experience, strengthening their problem-solving skills and resilience.

In both scenarios, the ABCDE method helps the engineering team shift their cognitive outlook from pessimism to optimism, leading to improved performance, collaboration, and problem-solving. It demonstrates the practical applicability of Seligman's cognitive theory in real-world engineering challenges.

## How to Prime Your Mind for Optimism

### We can shift our mindset toward more optimism and happiness.

BY [CATHERINE A. SANDERSON](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/profile/catherine_sanderson) | SEPTEMBER 23, 2019

- [_Print_](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_to_prime_your_mind_for_optimism#)
 - [_Bookmark_](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/_ajax/login-popup)

When I was in my early twenties, my boyfriend, Bart, and I were driving on a freeway near downtown Atlanta when we got a flat tire. I immediately panicked—this was long before everyone had cell phones. I worried we would be stranded for hours, that I’d have to either walk alone and get help or stay alone with the car, that our whole day would be ruined by this car trouble.

![](https://ggsc.s3.amazonaws.com/images/made/images/uploads/How_to_Prime_Your_Mind_for_Optimism_300_200_int_c1-1x.jpg)

As Bart pulled to the side of the road, I shared my numerous concerns. He looked questioningly at me and said, “I’m just going to change the tire—it will take a couple of minutes.” He changed the tire, and we were soon on our way.

This story illustrates an important principle: Some people find it easier to adopt a positive attitude than others, which influences how they respond to life’s setbacks. While I saw the flat tire as a major problem, my boyfriend saw it as a minor inconvenience. His more positive mindset kept him calm and allowed him to take appropriate action. My more pessimistic outlook simply led me to suffer and feel helpless.

This difference in how we perceive and respond to events and challenges in our lives matters for our happiness and health. When we have more optimistic mindsets, we are better able to buffer the effects of common daily life stressors and still feel happy. And, as [one study](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/37/18357) found, optimism is healthy for us: People ages 40 to 90 tended to live longer if they were more optimistic—even taking into account other factors, like their diet, smoking and alcohol use, depression, and health conditions.

But here’s the good news for those of us who have trouble finding the silver lining: Our mindsets can change. We can shift our attitude in a more optimistic direction, no matter our natural inclination, with time, energy, and effort. Here are five research-based strategies for doing that. 

## 1. Reframe stressors

Stress is unavoidable. We all experience daily hassles—like long lines, irritating coworkers, and endless to-do lists. While we can’t eliminate all stress, we can choose _how_ we think about the challenges we face and adopt a new, more positive mindset around them.

Of course, some optimistic people seem to do this naturally. (Lucky them!) They go through life easily seeing the positive in irritations and bad events, which [helps](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132556/) protect their mood. If positive reframing doesn’t come naturally to you, start by trying to focus on what’s good about your daily life stressors instead of what’s bad about them. For example, if you’re stuck in a traffic jam, take time to look out the window at nature and focus on its beauty.

Here are some examples of how you might transform a setback into something positive:

- Stuck in an airport? Consider it unexpected free time to call a friend or read a good book.
- Passed over for a promotion? This could mean it’s the perfect time to polish your resume or explore other—perhaps even more fulfilling—career options.
- No plans on New Year’s Eve? Fully embrace cozying up in front of the TV and watching the festivities in comfort, or maybe appreciate getting an early start on that New Year’s resolution to clean out your overflowing closet.

We can’t control what life throws at us, but we can all practice reframing difficult events as challenges to be mitigated, rather than calamities.

## 2. Practice self-compassion

Some people have a tendency to beat themselves up when things don’t go their way—which, not surprisingly, doesn’t make them feel better. To shift our mindset in a more positive direction, we can simply give ourselves a break and treat ourselves with kindness, [the same way we’d treat a close friend](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/how_would_you_treat_a_friend) who’s having a hard time.

People who [practice](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009265660600095X) self-compassion are less [likely](https://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/LearyJPSP.pdf) to blame themselves when bad things happen, which works in their favor: They are less anxious and depressed and overall feel happier and more optimistic about the future. For example, first-year college students who have more self-compassion during this difficult life transition are more engaged and motivated in college life—perhaps [because](https://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Gunnell2017.pdf) they feel better able to handle the challenges college presents and more connected to other people in their lives.

So, when bad things happen, cut yourself some slack. Forgive yourself, be kind to yourself, and treat yourself with care and compassion.

## 3. Let it go

Besides blaming themselves for setbacks, people can also fall into the trap of ruminating on bad events long after they’re over. Rather than accepting what’s happened and moving on, they get stuck in their negative feelings—then, to make matters worse, they beat themselves up for feeling bad! 

People who criticize themselves for having negative thoughts and feelings have [higher levels of depression and anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28703602), and lower levels of psychological well-being and life satisfaction. That’s because when you blame yourself for your feelings, it [creates a vicious cycle](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0146640283900139), where ruminating leads to bad feelings which lead to more ruminating.

If you find yourself ruminating about a fight with a friend, a difficult situation at work, or the current state of American politics, try a new approach: Identify and stop resisting these negative thoughts and feelings. For example, you might think, “I’m feeling lonely,” or “My job isn’t going well,” or “I’m frustrated right now by our government.” Naming and accepting your negative emotions and thoughts will [help](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28703602) keep you from holding onto them so tightly and will clear the way for a more positive attitude and response. 

## 4. Avoid comparisons and practice gratitude instead

There’s a [great poem](https://medium.com/@bobsutton/kurt-vonnegut-joe-heller-and-a-thanksgiving-message-8a31ca397888) by Kurt Vonnegut about his conversation with author Joseph Heller during a party hosted by a billionaire. When Vonnegut asks Heller how he feels knowing that this billionaire makes more money in a single day than Heller will ever earn from sales of his novel _Catch-22_, Heller responds that he has something that the billionaire will never have: the knowledge that he’s got enough.

![This essay is adapted from <a href=“http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1946885444?ie=UTF8&tag=gregooscicen-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1946885444”><em>The Positive Shift: Mastering Mindset to Improve Happiness, Health, and Longevity</em></a> (BenBella Books, 2019, 224 pages).](https://ggsc.s3.amazonaws.com/images/made/images/uploads/The_Positive_Shift_200_295_int_c1-1x.jpg)This essay is adapted from [_The Positive Shift: Mastering Mindset to Improve Happiness, Health, and Longevity_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1946885444?ie=UTF8&tag=gregooscicen-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1946885444) (BenBella Books, 2019, 224 pages).

This poem vividly illustrates what research corroborates: Happy people [don’t need](http://sonjalyubomirsky.com/wp-content/themes/sonjalyubomirsky/papers/LR1997.pdf) to engage in social comparisons. Instead, they practice gratitude for what they have—a good way [to increase](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54694fa6e4b0eaec4530f99d/t/565f5969e4b05a14ac75ee6c/1449089385801/Gratitude+as+a+Psychotherapeutic+Intervention+2013.pdf) optimism and well-being.

While people vary considerably in how much they engage in social comparison, those of us with a more negative mindset find it hard to avoid, particularly on social media. Most people post only the good parts of their lives—successful kids, fabulous vacations, impressive careers—which can lead us to believe that our own lives don’t measure up.

This may be why college students [believe](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21177878) that they experience more negative events (e.g., bad grades) and fewer positive events (e.g., fun parties) than their peers, which makes them lonely and dissatisfied with life. In contrast, college students encouraged to practice gratitude by counting their blessings [tend to be happier](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/pdfs/GratitudePDFs/6Emmons-BlessingsBurdens.pdf) than their peers.

If you find yourself in a comparison trap, try quitting your social media habit, or at least shifting how you think about the overly positive portrayals you find there. Instead of feeling sad about how your life doesn’t measure up, focus on the very real things that are good in your life—e.g., my kid’s not going to be valedictorian, but he’s got a great group of friends; my family’s not spending two weeks in Tahiti, but we really enjoy our summer on the Jersey Shore. 

## 5. Find some (any) humor

In virtually any situation, it is possible to find some humor, and making an effort to do so can help you adopt a more positive mindset later on. I remember when my high school freshman son Andrew received a failing grade—a 58—in his first trimester of Spanish. Although it worried me, he was able to find the humor in it, insisting that it wasn’t an F; it was an F+! And Andrew’s optimistic interpretation actually paid off: At his high school graduation, he received the award for “most improved,” and, ironically, he’s now a college junior majoring in Spanish!

Finding humor helps people cope with the small irritations of daily life, but it is particularly important in coping with serious life circumstances. For example, people with fibromyalgia (a debilitating and chronic condition marked by widespread bodily pain) who relied on smiling and laughter to deal with small daily life stressors—such as a waiter spilling water on you—[reported](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217699583) lower levels of psychological distress and fewer physical symptoms. This ability to take things in stride reduces stress and its negative effects on physical and psychological well-being.

So, the next time you are in a dark or trying situation, try humor. Remind yourself that this situation will probably make for a good story later, and try to crack a joke about it. Say you’re laid off; imagine the most absurd way you could spend your last day, or the most ridiculous job you could pursue next—like kangaroo handler or bubblegum sculptor. Allowing yourself to experience humor can take the edge off.

I’ve used these strategies in my own life, and even though my natural inclination is clearly not to see the silver lining, I find it easier all the time to shift my thinking in ways that do make me happier. Adopting this type of optimistic worldview has taken me time, energy, and effort, but it has really paid off. This shift has helped me feel happier. 

If this type of positive mindset doesn’t come naturally to you, don’t despair. Try to find someone who can help you cultivate this skill by being a role model. Remember that boyfriend of mine who miraculously changed the tire? He’s now my husband.

For example, a positive outlook about a team’s chances of achieving its goals increases cooperation within the team because team members predict that their cooperative effort is a good investment of their time and energy. In today’s workplace, where time and energy are a scarce resource, this “intangible” is necessary for team success.

predictions that help us prioritize actions that are in the best interest of our needs. 15 Because emotion is so central to those calculations, a positive outlook and sense of confidence in the team influences the choices team members make, including their choice to engage in the cooperative, collaborative behavior required for the highest levels of team performance.

Hill found that these intangibles were the result of the team leader’s focus on building an environment (i.e., a community) with a shared sense of purpose, values, and clear rules of engagement (i.e., norms) that turn values into habits. This point of view agrees with the view we present in our team emotional intelligence theory—effective team leadership involves building an environment.

satisfying team members’ social needs for shared understanding about the team’s current reality and control over that reality. We label the first norm: Creating an Affirmative Environment. This norm, or informal rule, suggests that although the team continually seeks to identify and acknowledge its problems, it juxtaposes that with also building hope and optimism by asking questions such as: “What is the silver lining here?

A second norm we identified in our research on high performing teams also contributes to a team’s positive outlook and sense of team efficacy. We’ve labelled his norm, Proactive Problem Solving.

## examples
**Example 1: Success through Empathy in Software Production**

In a software development company, a team was tasked with creating a complex software product for a client in the healthcare industry. The project had tight deadlines and involved multiple stakeholders with diverse backgrounds. The team's empathetic approach played a crucial role in the project's success.

1. **Three Types of Empathy**: The team exhibited Cognitive Empathy by thoroughly researching the client's needs and challenges in the healthcare sector. They demonstrated Emotional Empathy by understanding the stress and urgency the client faced. Compassionate Empathy was evident in their commitment to delivering a solution that would genuinely improve the client's operations and help patients.
    
2. **Key Characteristics of Empathetic Communication**:
    
    - **Active Listening**: Team members regularly held meetings with the client to actively listen to their concerns, feedback, and expectations.
    - **Intentional Speaking**: They communicated their progress and ideas clearly and with sensitivity to the client's perspective.
3. **Nonverbal Communication**: The team frequently met the client in person, displaying nonverbal cues such as body language and facial expressions to convey their dedication and understanding.
    
4. **Behaviors of Collaborative Teams**: The team fostered an environment where each member felt valued, encouraged to share ideas, and supported in challenging times, creating a culture of empathy.
    
5. **Overcoming Barriers**: When faced with technical challenges, the team maintained open and honest communication with the client, demonstrating vulnerability, which further deepened their empathetic relationship.
    
6. **Putting Empathy into Operation**:
    
    - They scheduled regular check-ins with the client.
    - Created a shared online space for transparent project updates.
    - Assigned a dedicated point of contact for the client to ensure constant communication.

**Tips for Individual Contributors and Managers/Leaders in Engineering Teams to Improve Empathy**:

For Individual Contributors:

- Attend workshops or training sessions on empathy in the workplace.
- Practice active listening during team meetings.
- Seek feedback from colleagues to understand how your actions affect them.

For Managers/Leaders:

- Lead by example; display empathy in your interactions with team members.
- Encourage open and honest communication.
- Foster a supportive team culture where empathy is valued.

**Recommended Resources**:

Podcasts:

1. "Empathy at Work" by Mimi Nicklin.
2. "The Power of Empathy" on the Harvard Business Review podcast.

2. The Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley's blog on emotional intelligence and empathy.

Promoting empathy in software development can lead to better collaboration, improved client relationships, and ultimately, the success of projects.

**Example 2: Failure due to Lack of Empathy in Software Production**

In another software development company, a team embarked on a project to create a cutting-edge AI-powered application for a non-profit organization dedicated to education. However, their lack of empathy led to project failure.

1. **Three Types of Empathy**: The team lacked Cognitive Empathy as they did not deeply understand the non-profit's unique educational challenges. They displayed a lack of Emotional Empathy, failing to recognize the non-profit's passion for their cause. Compassionate Empathy was missing in their interactions as they prioritized technical aspects over the non-profit's mission.
    
2. **Key Characteristics of Empathetic Communication**:
    
    - **Active Listening**: The team rarely listened to the non-profit's input and instead pushed their own technical solutions.
    - **Intentional Speaking**: When they did communicate, it was often in technical jargon, leaving the non-profit confused.
3. **Nonverbal Communication**: Due to geographical distance, most communication was through email, causing misunderstandings and a lack of emotional connection.
    
4. **Behaviors of Collaborative Teams**: The team's lack of empathy created frustration, and the non-profit felt unheard and disrespected.
    
5. **Overcoming Barriers**: Instead of addressing misunderstandings and concerns, the team dismissed them, exacerbating the lack of empathy.
    
6. **Putting Empathy into Operation**:
    
    - Regular video calls could have facilitated more meaningful communication.
    - The team should have prioritized understanding the non-profit's mission before diving into technical discussions.

**Tips for Improvement**:

For Individual Contributors:

- Reflect on your interactions with clients or colleagues and assess if empathy is lacking.
- Seek feedback from others about how they perceive your communication style.

For Managers/Leaders:

- Invest in empathy training for your team.
- Encourage team members to regularly check in with clients and stakeholders.

**Recommended Resources**:

Empathy-Driven Development: How Engineers Can Tap into This Critical Skill

# Empathy-Driven Development: How Engineers Can Tap into This Critical Skill

“You can’t say the word ‘empathy’ at a software company. No one will take you seriously.”

**[Andrea Goulet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreamgoulet/ "null")** couldn’t believe what she had heard. The advice came from a well-intentioned consultant she had hired as she was growing her team at **[Corgibytes](https://corgibytes.com/ "null")**, back in 2009. She had wanted to incorporate empathy as a core value, but was confronted with the industry-wide misconception that empathy and technical skills were irreconcileable.

Fast forward a decade, and it seems that attitudes have shifted. “We’ve come a long way from when people treated empathy as a dirty word. I’ve actually given a few keynotes on the topic now, and engineers are increasingly interested in what I have to say,” says Goulet.

But in her eyes, the conversation is just getting started — and still falling short. “It’s great that we’re in this moment of celebrating empathy and talking about how important it is at work. But we have to be careful that it doesn’t get too abstracted or contained to a surface-level discussion,” she says. “What I’m seeing is that, more often than not, the conversation stops at ‘Be more empathetic!’ We need to take it a step forward and recognize empathy as a skill that can be learned and applied."

For those who believe empathy falls into the nebulous realm of the touchy-feely, that takeaway might seem counterintuitive. But given her background, Goulet is uniquely equipped to draw the connection. She began her career as a copywriter, a role that depends on understanding and fostering a connection with readers. When she pivoted to engineering and founded Corgibytes out of a dedication to [building technical wealth by remodeling technical debt](https://firstround.com/review/forget-technical-debt-heres-how-to-build-technical-wealth/ "null"), she was surprised to find striking similarities between the seemingly disparate skills of copywriting and writing code.

“Coding and copywriting are more similar than you’d think. There’s a misconception that the programming languages we use are only written for machines,” she says. “But we don’t write code in ones and zeroes, right? We write code in compiled languages so that other humans can read it, whether that’s our team or our future selves. **Coding is a form of communication. Communication is rooted in empathy. So software engineers have a lot to gain from leveraging empathy as a tactical skill.”**

Today, the co-founder and CEO is proud to say that she did, in fact, [concretize empathy as a core value](https://corgibytes.com/about/ "null") at Corgibytes. Now, armed with her insights from implementing empathy at her own company, she’s determined to change the way that the tech industry talks about this critical skill.

In this exclusive interview, Goulet busts the three myths that are preventing engineers from honing their empathetic expertise. She explains why leaving communication artifacts in your code is an exercise in empathy, and she introduces Empathy-Driven Development, a highly procedural framework for embedding this critical skill into engineering teams. Whether you’re just setting off on the road of empathy or looking to take your practice to the next level, Goulet offers a mix of beginner’s tips and advanced strategies. Ultimately, she challenges entrepreneurs to see empathy not as an abstraction or an innate talent, but as a powerful, actionable tool that belongs in every engineer’s toolbox.

# FIRST, DISPEL THESE EMPATHY MYTHS

While the consensus may be emerging that empathy is important, Goulet fears the conversation around this critical skill in the engineering world is leading us astray. “If people don’t have a firm, technical understanding of empathy, it’s easier to dismiss it,” she says. “They might make assumptions about what it means, which ends up reinforcing stereotypes about it, or even taking us backward.”

Here, Goulet dismantles three common myths around empathy to help founders and technical leads understand and develop empathy on their teams.

# Myth #1: Empathy is just a feeling.

The software industry’s long-held reluctance to embrace empathy is rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of what, exactly, empathy is. “Most people believe that empathy is just a feeling,” she says. “And it definitely _involves_ feelings. However, that conceptualization of empathy is really limiting.”

In her quest to build a case for empathy, Goulet stumbled upon [Indi Young’s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/indiyoung/ "null") _[Practical Empathy](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/practical-empathy/ "null")_, in which the author, a researcher who started her career as a programmer, delineates not one, but six types of empathy. “That sub-categorization really struck me. I thought if something could be divided into six subsets, then it must be pretty dense and technical,” says Goulet.

“Indi writes that empathy is a noun — it’s the thing you’ve acquired after you’ve listened to someone and truly understood their point of view. She also dives deep on one of those subtypes called **cognitive empathy**, which is a _rational_ process that’s used to uncover another person’s beliefs, values, preferences, and points of view. This process is already ingrained in the work of marketers, UX researchers, writers, designers, even many front-end engineers,” says Goulet. “My goal was to really study Indi’s work, that’s so well established in the UX community, and then find a way to extend it for people who operate more on the back-end.”

Drawing inspiration from Young’s scholarship, as well as the research of [Dr. Brené Brown](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brenebrown/ "null"), Goulet developed a working definition of cognitive empathy geared toward engineers: **“Empathy is proactive perspective-taking and problem-solving.”**

Goulet’s crisp definition enables engineers to dive into implementation and set aside their fears about not being equipped for the task. “If you’re in software, you’re likely an excellent problem-solver. You’ve already won half the battle,” she says. “And once you understand cognitive empathy, it’s the key to understanding the rich world of the other subtypes.”

Empathy is not this abstract, metaphysical enigma. It’s a skill we need to respect and a muscle we need to flex.

# Myth #2: Empathy is irrelevant to building software.

When most people think about the skills needed to be an effective engineer, empathy is probably not the first that comes to mind. “We need to deal with false misconceptions about engineers and professional skills,” says Goulet. “For example, I hate the ‘Are you technical or nontechnical?’ question. It’s not binary. You can be technical and know how to be a skilled, empathetic communicator. I would argue that if you want to be an excellent engineer, you _should_ know how to communicate, in addition to knowing how to make a machine work the way you expect it to.”

While leaning into empathy has proven useful for [building diverse and inclusive teams](https://firstround.com/review/heres-how-to-wield-empathy-and-data-to-build-an-inclusive-team/ "null") and [earning designers a seat at the table](https://firstround.com/review/How-Designers-Can-Earn-a-Seat-at-the-Table-2/ "null"), Goulet contends that empathy is an increasingly necessary skill for engineers.

“With commit messages, pull requests, naming, tests, error messages, those are all fundamentally about communicating with empathy,” she says. “If there’s anything that [working with legacy code](https://firstround.com/review/forget-technical-debt-heres-how-to-build-technical-wealth/ "null") has taught me, it’s that **code isn’t written in a vacuum; it’s reviewed and revisited constantly**. Your future reader could be a colleague. It could be yourself, six months later,” she says.

“If you don’t take the future reader into consideration by clearly communicating your reasoning, you’re creating problematic legacy code,” says Goulet. “And once that gets entrenched, the code base is much harder to remodel. Operating without empathy is directly linked to one of the biggest problems that plagues engineering teams. So don’t tell me that it’s not relevant to your day job.”

Sure, engineers are excellent problem solvers. But I think what gets overlooked is that engineers are also, inherently, communicators. Coding is all about delivering messages to people, as well as machines.

Furthermore, Goulet argues that empathy can help engineers avoid another future problem: baking bias directly into the software they build. “We’re past the point of pretending that code written by humans is immune to human prejudice,” she says, pointing to high-profile incidents where [facial recognition algorithms demonstrated racial bias](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/technology/facial-recognition-race-artificial-intelligence.html "null"), or when machine learning software reproduced [biases against women](https://www.wired.com/story/machines-taught-by-photos-learn-a-sexist-view-of-women/ "null").

“[Diversity and inclusion isn’t just about team composition](https://firstround.com/review/eight-ways-to-make-your-dandi-efforts-less-talk-and-more-walk/ "null"). D&I is a critical ingredient to building better products that work for everyone — something that all engineers should strive to do,” says Goulet. “Training developers in a deeper understanding of empathy is a crucial first step toward that end goal.”

# Myth #3: Empathy can’t be taught.

“People find it easy to say, ‘Learn how to code, and here are the steps you can take.’ But there’s a misconception that empathy is either something you have or don’t have, and that it can’t be developed,” says Goulet.

Acknowledging that empathy is a trainable skill is the first step in improving on it. “**It’s hard to apply a growth mindset to a trait you think is inherent and fixed.** But with a practical breakdown of what empathy is, how to apply it, and how to cultivate it, there’s a path forward,” she says.

“While we of course need to be sensitive and accommodating of individuals who might struggle to express empathy, I think we need to challenge the field of engineering to do better,” says Goulet. “We need to dispense with the incredibly damaging and limiting stereotype of the ‘socially inept engineer.’ It signals that just because someone happens to be good with machines that they don’t need to or aren’t capable of working on other skills that are essential to company and product building. The truth is, you have the capacity to be all of those things.”

The technical skills gap may very well be real, but consider the other side of the coin: Most computer science students aren’t developing the communication and empathy skills they need to collaborate and successfully build products that work for everyone.

Andrea Goulet, CEO of Corgibytes

# THE STARTER KIT FOR EMBEDDING EMPATHY INTO YOUR ENGINEERING PRACTICE

Like learning a programming language or training for a sport, building empathy should be part of an ongoing practice. Goulet shares three guiding principles you can lean on as you start to sharpen your aptitude for empathy:

# 1. Swap blame for honor.

Engineers are probably familiar with this scenario: You revisit old code that’s totally inscrutable, with no rationale to be found. Cue the flare-up of frustration. “The usual reaction is, _My god, who was the idiot who decided to do it like this_? Blame is literally baked into our tooling,” says Goulet. “If you want to see a history of changes to the code, the default command is ‘git blame’ on the command line. That small cognitive priming conditions developers to look down on the contributions of the people who came before them.”

But shaming the original developer wastes precious time and energy. “We need to [move beyond blame](https://firstround.com/review/this-is-how-effective-leaders-move-beyond-blame/ "null") and shame. They’re unproductive, and [the opposite of empathy](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/brene-brown-shame_n_3807115 "null"),” says Goulet. “Instead, **when you approach code, honor the work of the people who came before you.** Think _Okay, I assume that people did their best work. Why did they choose this solution?_ That’s when you’ll get far more illuminating answers.”

Goulet suggests thinking about constraints to help you have more empathy for past developers. “**No one wakes up in the morning and decides to write the worst code possible.** That just doesn’t make sense,” she says. “People are up against real world constraints that impact code quality — time, budget, technical limitations and unrealistic expectations. Follow the constraints and you’ll uncover the deeper reason that the codebase isn’t up to your expectations.”

You can’t begin to solve problems, much less modernize an entire code base, without empathy. Analyzing problems through another engineer’s perspective is hard, sophisticated work that’s rooted in understanding why someone made the choices they did.

# 2. Consider your project like an archeological dig.

When it comes to constructing empathetic coding practices, Goulet encourages engineers to envision old code bases as archeological sites.

“When archeologists study an ancient site, they don’t have the whole story about what life was like at the time. They have to look for artifacts: pottery, coins, sometimes writing,” she says. “Similarly, if you leave **communication artifacts** in your code now, it makes interpreting your code much easier for future developers.”

While she’s long argued that communication artifacts give you an operational advantage when you’re [re-architecting legacy code and pulling out from a mound of technical debt](https://firstround.com/review/forget-technical-debt-heres-how-to-build-technical-wealth/ "null"), Goulet has since realized that the act of producing them is also, at its core, an exercise in empathy.

“Yes, if I leave communication artifacts behind, that’ll save the next person time. But these breadcrumbs of my thinking also serve a dual purpose that’s deeply rooted in empathy. It really goes back to that definition of empathy, that proactive perspective-taking and problem-solving. When I try to think of what I can do to be helpful, I’m exercising empathy for those who will come after me,” she says. “Ultimately, that empathy creates trust between myself, team members and future readers, because it’s almost like we’re all looking out for each other.”

Many software luminaries have invoked the old Scouting rule by saying, “Leave the code better than you found it.” When you practice empathy, you’re supercharging that motto.

She identifies three touchpoints where engineers can leave communication artifacts that make an impact on code, and leave a legacy of trust.

**In your code review:** Merge requests and other similar invitations to review code before it goes into production are ideal places for engineers to practice leaving communication artifacts. “Remember that the conversation you have isn’t just for your code reviewer,” says Goulet. “Think bigger. You’re preserving rationale for your future self. For a developer who is going to have to interact with that piece of code when they’re fixing a bug. For a customer success manager. Take on their perspectives for a second: What will be useful to them? What will help give them context?”

**In your commit messages:** “Commit messages are the absolute best form of documentation because they’re tightly coupled to a code base,” she says. “People often forget that a commit is made up of two components: The title and the message. As my friend, [Dave Bock](https://twitter.com/bokmann "null") says, the title should be the length of a short tweet, and the description should be the length of a blog post, if necessary.”

**In your emails and company messaging system:** “Whenever you interact with someone else, there’s an opportunity to leave a communication artifact,” says Goulet. “That might be a short email or Slack message that informs, asks a question, or solicits feedback. Instead of just dropping a link without context or saying, “here’s the thing I did” add some context that shows that you have listened and are open to feedback. A simple sentence such as ‘Here’s what I came up with based on my understanding. What’s your perspective?’ goes a long way to building trust and collaboration.”

# 3. Think like a copywriter.

Given that writing is perhaps the most frequent vehicle for delivering empathy in the workplace, engineers can benefit from a few lessons from the copywriting world. “Writers need to hone empathy early on, because they’re writing to connect with an audience,” says Goulet. Whether you’re crafting commit messages or an email, Goulet offers her best writing tips for engineers:

**Keep your tone casual and conversational.** Many feel pressure to “decorate” their language with extravagant jargon or intricate syntax in a professional setting. Resist that urge. “The most effective language is clear, concise, and natural,” says Goulet. “Good writing is simple writing.”

**Never underestimate the power of the second person active voice.** “This is one of the most important pieces of advice I got as a copywriter,” she says. A quick grammar refresher: In second person, the writer directly addresses the reader, using “you.” The active voice makes clear that the reader is carrying out the action. “Second person active voice is the difference between the passive ‘_A bug has been detected’_ and the active, more empathetic ‘_Sorry, you’re experiencing a bug,_’” says Goulet_._

**Don’t make assumptions.** “Don’t assume that everyone who is reading your writing knows everything about what you’re writing about,” says Goulet. “If you’re writing about an esoteric concept, take a bit of time to explain it. If you’re using an acronym, spell out each word the first time it’s used. That way, your writing is more accessible to readers who have different skills and strengths from yourself.”

To help her keep empathy at the center of her practice, Goulet leans on advice she received from her one of her mentors, [Sam Horn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samhorn "null"), early in her copywriting career. “Sam is a brilliant communicator who taught me so much about empathy and ideation,” Goulet says. “She always told me, ‘A short pencil is better than a long memory.’ **As you’re working, instead of ignoring the ideas that come up, write them down. Then, find ways to turn your ideas into action by leveraging and sharing the communication artifacts you’re already creating as you go about your daily work**.”

All too often, empathetic ideas about how to improve upon a process, or how to clean up code for the next person, get lost in the crush of day-to-day demands. Keeping a running idea log while you’re working minimizes context switching while building the habit of creating artifacts of your ideas. “Over time, the link between idea generation and where to share will become more intuitive as you spot patterns and learn what works best,” says Goulet.

To help get your idea log up and running, leverage the tooling you’re already using so there’s the least amount of friction and context switching to document an idea. “If you’re comfortable on the command line, a quick search for ‘command line journal’ will give you a plethora of tools you can try,” she says. “Alternatively, Git-based wikis such as [GitHub](https://github.com/ "null")’s wiki and [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/ "null") allow developers to keep a log of ideas and notes using a text editor and Git client.”

# ELEVATE YOUR EMPATHY: AN ADVANCED FRAMEWORK FOR EMPATHY-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

For those engineers who love a good framework, Goulet breaks down a procedural model of cognitive empathy, creating an algorithm of sorts that teams can integrate into their workflow. She calls it **Empathy-Driven Development**.

“[Test-Driven Development](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/tdd-red-green-refactor "null") can be described as red, green, refactor. Likewise, Empathy-Driven Development can be distilled into **audience** and **action**,” says Goulet. “First, consider your audience, the people who are going to be interacting with your content, which includes your code and the communication artifacts you leave behind. Then, take action. Think about how you can proactively anticipate their needs.”

![Six steps of Empathy-Driven Development](https://assets.proof.pub/2056/firstround/pHpIKYLbRWqXjAYyzKHU_Empathy%20Algorithm%201.jpg)

The Empathy-Driven Development framework

To illustrate Empathy-Driven Development at work, Goulet gives an example of a problem you might encounter as a developer at a small startup: “Let’s say you’re tasked with writing an error message for a bookkeeping app. How might you leverage empathy in this situation?” In this scenario, you’re leaving a primary communication artifact (the error message) for your audience.

First, consider the audience:

**Identify individuals.** “List out the individuals you anticipate encountering your work product, in addition to the end user. Odds are, your audience includes a diversity of users,” says Goulet. “In this example, your audience might include a user who’s a freelance artist, a customer success manager at your company and your future self.”

**Consider context.** “Once you’ve identified the individuals, think about where they came from, and where they are now,” says Goulet. “The artist uses the app on his phone; the customer success manager is responding to a support ticket under pressure; your future self is reading your own code while fixing a bug, six months later.”

**Define their needs.** Finally, consider each individual’s challenges and needs. “Pain points aren’t always evident. Ask questions, read articles — do all that you can to find out about them,” she says. “What does the person using the app and the time-strapped customer success manager need from you? What will your future self need?”

Then, take action:

**What’s the best action to take?** “So you’ve gathered valuable information on your audience. Use that new understanding to think about what can be done to help,” she says. “You want to validate the user’s frustration with the error message. For the customer success manager, you want to make an easy reference code in the error message. For your future self, you might want to fix all the bugs right now.”

**What’s feasible?** “You won’t always be in a position to do the _best_ thing to help, so consider what you actually _can_ do. What do you have the time and resources to execute, to make their lives a little better? There’s almost always _something_ you can do. Think tiny and atomic. Even the smallest actions add up,” says Goulet.

**Create secondary artifacts.** “Once you’ve created your primary communication artifact — a great, clear error message — your job isn’t over. Include secondary artifacts into your definition of done,” Goulet says. “Secondary artifacts are durable evidence of your ideas, rationale, and constraints that have come up while you’ve been working on the primary artifact, and can take many forms.” She suggests looking at the communication artifacts chart above for inspiration and even creating a quadrant for your project to generate even more ideas. “There are so many places where natural language exists in a software system. It’s not about burdensome documentation. It’s about doing what you’re already doing with more intention.”

Example of Empathy-Driven Development in action

Over time, and with enough practice, these steps start to become intuitive. Goulet recognizes that the process often feels slow and burdensome at first, but encourages developers to keep at it. “Like TDD, Empathy-Driven Development will feel slow at first. In the moment, it’s easy to think that leaving a communication artifact is unimportant, or that you don’t have time. But many artifacts take an extra thirty seconds, a few minutes at most, to complete a thought for a future reader. **The marginal gains you achieve by regularly leaving communication artifacts end up far outweighing the short-term time investment**,” says Goulet.

“It’s like that checklist you go through when you’re first learning to drive,” she says. “Once you get enough experience driving, checking all the mirrors becomes second-nature. The same goes for Empathy-Driven Development. Once you get into the habit, it becomes a healthy instinct.”

On the other hand, the effect of negligence compounds, as a lack of communication artifacts can constitute an unpleasant inheritance for future readers. “That’s what honestly makes software so much harder to maintain, because then future developers have to go back and reinvent the wheel,” Goulet says. “You already worked on developing your rationale. Now just take a moment to document it before you move on.”

Exercising empathy doesn’t add much time to your existing workflow and the benefits are far-reaching: A clear commit message today saves everyone time and frustration further down the road.

# EXPANDING EMPATHY BEYOND CODE

Your codebase isn’t the only thing that benefits from a dollop of empathy — engineering teams and entire companies do as well. From team practices to cultural paradigm shifts, Goulet shares her advanced practices for elevating empathy IRL.

# Let your team read your diary.

Leaving communication artifacts in your code isn’t the only way you can exercise empathy on a software team. In addition to a #shoutouts channel on Slack, Goulet’s team adopted the practice of keeping [daily journals](https://corgibytes.com/blog/2016/08/02/how-we-use-daily-journals/ "null"). “Everyone has a Wiki page that anyone on the team can see, and we keep running notes and reflections throughout the day,” she says. “Everyone has their own flavor of how they like to keep track of these micro-decisions. Some use bullet lists, others use sentences — whatever works best for each individual writer.”

As with communication artifacts in code, the time spent on daily journals ends up returning on their investment. “It usually takes less than 15 minutes at the end of the day to type up,” says Goulet. “I’ve had colleagues tell me that they were able to save so much time, because they were able to refer back to their thinking six months ago, or share with a colleague who is running into a challenge you’ve already encountered. I see this all the time on my team. Someone will ask for help and a teammate will give a link and say ‘I had the same thing a few months ago. Here’s my journal. Start at March 7th.’ It’s not a big investment of time to create a journal entry, but the outcomes have been transformative.”

# Turn everyone into a customer service representative.

Goulet believes that the fastest route to learn empathy as a skill is [through customer service](https://firstround.com/review/Eventbrites-VP-on-How-to-Build-an-Amazing-Customer-Service-Team-from-Scratch/ "null"), when you truly have to understand and anticipate the needs of the people using your software. “I was really inspired by Zappos’s culture,” says Goulet, citing the book _[Delivering Happiness](https://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Happiness-Profits-Passion-Purpose/dp/0446576220 "null")_ by Zappos CEO [Tony Hseih](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyhsieh/ "null"). “The value of customer support is instilled into everyone in the company — and I mean lawyers, developers, _everyone_.”

Early-stage startups are in a particularly advantageous position to begin to integrate an empathetic, user-centric ethos. “Early on in a startup’s lifespan is the perfect time to start to bake empathy into your culture. You can establish norms that everyone can adopt as your company grows: We’re going to value feedback from users. We’re going to constantly ask questions to understand them. This is a big part of the _[Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898 "null")_ movement — to get out and listen to what your customers want. Don’t relegate that to one person or department. Bring everyone into the fold.”

Empathy and seeking to understand the customer are skills that are commonly associated with user-facing roles. But when empathy is part of the mission and culture from devs to designers, it truly sets the company apart.

For larger companies, Goulet suggests taking a company-wide empathy training, such as Brené Brown’s program [Dare To Lead](https://daretolead.brenebrown.com/ "null"). “I had a few engineers who went into Dr. Brown’s training feeling skeptical,” she says. “But after the training, the skeptics were often the ones who expressed to me that those trainings really were worth it. Because we made space to have vulnerable conversations, I truly believe my entire team is more trusting and delivers better work as a result of that experience.”

# Lend an empathetic ear.

To take proactive perspective-taking a step further, Goulet suggests hosting **listening sessions**, another concept borrowed from [Indi Young’s work](https://indiyoung.com/how-to-build-trust-in-a-listening-session/ "null"). “Unlike casual conversations, listening sessions are explicitly tied to the goal of understanding another person’s reasoning, reactions and guiding principles,” Goulet says. “They’re designed to help you get out of the dangerous habit of making assumptions about what another person wants, and instead use qualitative data to inform your decision-making.”

If you’re a back-end engineer writing a function, it’s easy to abstract people out of your work. The more you seek to understand others, the easier it will be to consider their points of view while you’re coding.

“To get started, grab a copy of Indi’s [book](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/practical-empathy/ "null") or [take her training](https://indiyoung.com/learn-2/ "null") that gives detailed instructions on how to conduct a listening session. Then, have a colleague, friend or partner interview you. This will help you build empathy for what it’s like to be interviewed,” Goulet says. “As you get more comfortable, branch out and interview people with different job titles, or people who have knowledge about a problem you’re trying to solve.”

Approach your subject with a deep well of respect. “Time is the most precious thing that someone can give you. If someone decides to lend you their time, appreciate it,” she says.

Once the listening session has begun, leave your judgments at the door. “Remember that you’re there to collect data, not change minds. Just listen without shame, expectation or criticism,” says Goulet. “The goal is about earning the speaker’s trust and getting to their emotions and reasonings that underlie the superficial.”

Developers can use listening sessions to enhance their engineering practice. “Let’s say you’re a developer working with artificial intelligence. You read an [industry report](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612876/this-is-how-ai-bias-really-happensand-why-its-so-hard-to-fix/ "null") that algorithms are often subject to human bias which can lead to tremendous negative impacts for some groups of people. Empathy can help you take ownership of this problem,” she says.

“Instead of writing it off as someone else’s responsibility and doing nothing, do some proactive perspective-taking. Get curious. Listen. Be open-minded. Then, armed with qualitative data, you can take action and put your problem-solving superpowers to good use," she says. "That might be stopping to consider whether you’re training your deep-learning algorithm on a truly representative data sample, or raising a concern to your product owner addressing an accessibility problem with a new feature.”

# TAKEAWAYS AND TRUST FISSION: HOW EMPATHY FITS INTO THE FUTURE OF COMPANIES

While tech has made strides in embracing empathy as a value, Goulet challenges startups to take the next step of treating it like a technical skill.

For engineers looking to flex the muscle of empathy, start by dismantling long-held myths. Invest the time to create communication artifacts that will light the way for future readers of your code. Use Empathy-Driven Development to proactively understand your audience, then address their needs. Finally, uplevel your work by sharing journals with your team and building your own awareness of the broader ecosystem where your product operates.

Once teams and companies treat empathy as a skill and a habit, they can begin to experience a snowball effect of incredible cultural and technical gains. Goulet refers to this effect as **trust fission**: the compounding, accelerating, exponentially proliferating benefits that come from a team operating in harmony.

“People always say that the most important thing is to [create and accelerate trust on our teams](https://firstround.com/review/our-6-must-reads-for-creating-and-accelerating-trust-on-teams/ "null"). Well, trust is the output of empathy. **Empathy is what we can optimize for when we’re trying to generate a culture of trust**,” says Goulet.

A culture of trust fission paves a pathway for team members to exercise more agency and become leaders. “Because we took the time to build trust through empathy, my team is constantly ahead of the curve and anticipating my own moves. I’ll propose an idea, and someone on my team will say, ‘You’re absolutely right. I already thought about that. Here’s the progress we’ve made,’” says Goulet. **“That’s the end goal with empathy: Cultivating a culture where everyone proactively asks, ‘Is there something that I can do to make this just a little bit better for the next person who comes along?’”**

===============================

### Achievement Orientation
Achievement Orientation is an Emotional and Social Intelligence Leadership Competency that entails striving to meet or exceed a standard of excellence, appreciating feedback on our performance, and continually seeking ways to do things better.

There is more to consider with this competency beyond the simple motivation for rewards. A leader who has a high capacity for this competency is able to balance his or her personal drive with the needs of the organization as a whole. That involves self-management, relationship management, and understanding the context of a given situation.
- Our Brains and Achievement Orientation
- Developing a Balanced Drive to Achieve
- The Group Equivalent of Achievement Orientation

## Team version
The group/team equivalent of achievement orientation is often referred to as "team performance orientation" or "team goal orientation." This concept focuses on a team's collective commitment to achieving high standards, continuously improving, and striving for excellence together. Here are some examples and resources to explore this:

**Examples of Team Performance Orientation:**

1. **Sports Teams:** Sports teams, such as soccer or basketball teams, are excellent examples of groups with a strong team performance orientation. They set specific goals (e.g., winning a championship), practice rigorously, and continuously seek to improve their skills and strategies as a team.
    
2. **Project Teams:** In the business world, project teams with a team performance orientation set clear project goals, timelines, and quality standards. They work collaboratively, share feedback, and adapt their approach to meet or exceed these goals.
    
3. **Educational Groups:** Student study groups or academic research teams that aim for excellence in their coursework or research projects are also good examples. They set learning or research objectives and strive to achieve outstanding results together.
    

**Resources to Explore Team Performance Orientation:**

1. **Book:** "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team" by Patrick Lencioni. This book explores the elements of a high-performing team, including commitment to common goals and collective accountability.
    
2. **Book:** "Team Geek: A Software Developer's Guide to Working Well with Others" by Ben Collins-Sussman, et al. This book focuses on building high-performing software development teams with a performance-oriented mindset.
    
3. **Article:** "Building a High-Performance Team" by Harvard Business Review. This article provides insights into creating and leading teams that prioritize performance and results.
    
4. **Tool:** Tuckman's Stages of Group Development. Understanding the stages of team development, including forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning, can help teams progress toward a performance-oriented mindset.
    
5. **Workshops and Training:** Many organizations offer team-building workshops and training programs that emphasize performance orientation, goal setting, and collaboration.
    
6. **Consulting Services:** Consider consulting services specializing in team development and performance improvement. These professionals can provide tailored guidance and strategies for fostering a culture of achievement within your team or organization.
    
7. **Leadership and Team Development Coaches:** Engaging a coach who specializes in leadership and team development can be highly beneficial in helping your team adopt a performance-oriented mindset.
    
8. **Online Communities:** Join online communities or forums focused on team leadership, performance, and goal achievement. Engaging with like-minded individuals and sharing experiences can offer valuable insights.
    

Remember that fostering team performance orientation often involves a combination of leadership, communication, goal setting, and a commitment to continuous improvement. It's about creating an environment where team members are motivated to work collaboratively and achieve excellence collectively.

### Conflict management
The Emotional Intelligence competency we call Conflict Management involves having the ability to help others through tense situations, tactfully bringing disagreements into the open, and defining solutions that everyone can endorse. Leaders who take time to understand different perspectives work toward finding a common ground on which everyone can agree. They acknowledge the views of all sides, while redirecting the energy toward a shared ideal or an agreeable resolution.

There are eight categories in the book. There's the insecure manager, the pessimist, the victim, the passive-aggressive peer, the know-it-all, the tormentor—the person who you expect to be your mentor but is actually making your life miserable—the biased colleague, and then the political operator



**Example 1: Good Conflict Management Leading to Success in a Software Project**

**Scenario**: A software development team, led by a manager skilled in conflict management, faces a significant disagreement about the project's architecture.

**Conflict Management Factors**:

- **Stay Calm**: The manager remains calm and composed when the disagreement arises, setting a positive tone for the conversation.
- **Avoid Personal Attacks**: The focus of the conversation is on the technical aspects of the project, not on attacking team members personally.
- **Communication Skills**: The manager effectively communicates the pros and cons of different architectural choices.
- **Seeking Help on Time**: Recognizing the complexity of the issue, the manager involves relevant stakeholders and experts to provide input.

**Outcome**: The conflict is resolved through a productive discussion. The team decides on an architectural solution that takes into account different perspectives and expertise. This solution results in a more efficient and scalable software architecture. The project continues smoothly, and the team's cohesion strengthens.

**Example 2: Lack of Good Conflict Management Leading to Failure in a Software Project**

**Scenario**: In another software development project, the team lacks effective conflict management skills, and tensions rise over disagreements about project priorities and timelines.

**Issues with Conflict Management**:

- **Lack of Calmness**: Team members and the project manager become agitated and stressed when conflicts arise, escalating the situation.
- **Personal Attacks**: Disagreements turn personal, with team members blaming each other for project delays and issues.
- **Poor Communication**: Team members struggle to communicate their concerns effectively, leading to misunderstandings.
- **Failure to Seek Help**: The team does not seek external input or mediation when conflicts become unmanageable.

**Outcome**: The project is plagued by constant conflicts, missed deadlines, and low morale. Team members become disengaged and frustrated, leading to a high turnover rate. Ultimately, the software project fails to meet its goals, resulting in wasted resources.

**Tips to Improve Conflict Management in Software Projects**:

- **Stay Calm**: Encourage team members to remain calm and composed during disagreements. Provide stress management resources and lead by example in maintaining a calm demeanor.
- **Avoid Personal Attacks**: Promote a culture of professionalism and respect. Address personal attacks promptly and guide team members toward focusing on the issues rather than blaming individuals.
- **Effective Communication**: Provide communication training to team members to improve their ability to express concerns and ideas clearly. Encourage active listening and empathy within the team.
- **Seeking Help on Time**: Establish a process for involving external mediators or experts when conflicts escalate beyond the team's capacity for resolution. Recognize when it's time to seek outside assistance to prevent project derailment.

In both examples, conflict management skills significantly impact the outcome of software projects. Effective conflict management can lead to productive discussions, informed decisions, and successful project outcomes. To improve conflict management within software development teams, it's essential to prioritize emotional intelligence, communication skills, and a culture of respect and collaboration.


## Prompt 1
Certainly! Here's a summary of some important techniques in conflict management, along with references to credible resources and introductions to key researchers in the field. Each technique is accompanied by an example:

1. **Communication Skills**:
    
    - **Technique**: Improve active listening and effective communication to understand others' perspectives.
    - **Resource**: The book "Crucial Conversations" by Al Switzler, Joseph Grenny, and Ron McMillan provides valuable insights into effective communication during conflicts.
    - **Example**: Two team members in a software project actively listen to each other's concerns about project priorities, leading to a compromise that benefits both sides.
2. **Negotiation**:
    
    - **Technique**: Collaboratively seek a mutually acceptable solution through bargaining and compromise.
    - **Resource**: "Getting to Yes" by Roger Fisher and William Ury is a classic book on negotiation strategies.
    - **Example**: Team leaders negotiate resource allocation for competing software development projects, finding a balance that satisfies both teams.
3. **Mediation**:
    
    - **Technique**: Engage a neutral third party to facilitate communication and guide conflicting parties toward resolution.
    - **Resource**: "The Power of Communication" by Helio Fred Garcia discusses the role of effective communication in mediation.
    - **Example**: An external mediator helps resolve conflicts between two developers who have differing opinions on code implementation.
4. **Conflict Resolution Models**:
    
    - **Technique**: Utilize structured conflict resolution models, such as the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI), to identify and address conflict styles.
    - **Resource**: The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument provides a framework for understanding and managing conflict.
    - **Example**: A project manager uses the TKI model to identify that a team member avoids conflicts. They then encourage open communication to address underlying issues.
5. **Emotional Intelligence**:
    
    - **Technique**: Enhance emotional intelligence to regulate emotions and empathize with others during conflicts.
    - **Resource**: "Emotional Intelligence" by Daniel Goleman explains the importance of emotional intelligence in conflict management.
    - **Example**: A team leader recognizes team members' frustration during a challenging project and uses empathy to ease tensions and find solutions.
6. **Collaborative Problem Solving**:
    
    - **Technique**: Encourage collaboration to solve problems collectively, pooling resources and expertise.
    - **Resource**: The book "Collaborative Leadership" by David Archer offers strategies for effective collaboration.
    - **Example**: Developers collaborate to troubleshoot a critical software bug, combining their skills to identify and fix the issue.
7. **Assertiveness**:
    
    - **Technique**: Express your needs and concerns clearly and assertively without aggression.
    - **Resource**: "Your Perfect Right" by Robert Alberti and Michael Emmons provides guidance on assertiveness.
    - **Example**: A team member assertively communicates the need for a change in project scope due to unforeseen challenges, leading to a constructive discussion and adjustment.
8. **Conflict Coaching**:
    
    - **Technique**: Engage in one-on-one coaching with a conflict management expert to develop personalized conflict resolution strategies.
    - **Resource**: "The Handbook of Conflict Resolution" edited by Morton Deutsch, Peter T. Coleman, and Eric C. Marcus covers various conflict resolution techniques.
    - **Example**: A project manager undergoes conflict coaching to improve their ability to handle conflicts within their team effectively.

Researchers and experts in this field include Kenneth W. Thomas and Ralph H. Kilmann (creators of the TKI model), Daniel Goleman (emotional intelligence), and Morton Deutsch (conflict resolution theory). Exploring their works can provide a deeper understanding of conflict management techniques.

Remember that the choice of technique depends on the nature and context of the conflict. Effective conflict management involves selecting the most suitable approach for each situation.

## prompt 2

This is the definition of conflict management
"The Emotional Intelligence competency we call Conflict Management involves having the ability to help others through tense situations, tactfully bringing disagreements into the open, and defining solutions that everyone can endorse. Leaders who take time to understand different perspectives work toward finding a common ground on which everyone can agree. They acknowledge the views of all sides, while redirecting the energy toward a shared ideal or an agreeable resolution."

Use information on the web and the text below to come up with two examples. One is an example of good conflict management that results in a successful software project and one example where lack of good conflict management results in failure in the software project Give tips  and tools to improve this skill

Article:
### A gist of different topics covered in the book:

- A good part of dealing with people involves handling emotions – yours and theirs.
- Stay calm in adverse situations to not make it worse.
- Know what to do, and also know what not to say or do.
- Avoid personal attacks and focus on the goal of the conversation.
- Fight tactics, not people.
- Communication carries words, not intent.
- Learn from your boss and colleagues.
- Seek help on time.
- Learn when to stick on and when to leave.
- Ascertain if you are the problem and if you are the person difficult to deal with, and your role in the problem or situation.

Conflict, or more specifically, interpersonal conflict, is a fact of life, and particularly of organisational life. It often emerges more when people are stressed, for example, when there are changes on the horizon, or when everyone is under pressure because of a looming deadline.

However, conflict can also arise in relationships and situations outside work.

Handling conflict in ways that lead to increased stress can be detrimental to your health. Poor conflict management can lead to higher production of the stress hormone cortisol, and also cause hardening of the arteries, leading to increased risk of heart attacks and high blood pressure.

Learning to deal with conflict in a positive and constructive way, without excessive stress, is therefore an important way to improve your well-being as well as your relationships.

---

What is Conflict?
----------

Interpersonal conflict has been defined as:
*“An expressed struggle between at least two interdependent parties who perceive incompatible goals, scarce resources, and interference from the other party in achieving their goals”.*

Unpicking this a little, it means that for a disagreement to become a conflict, there needs to be:

* Some element of communication: a shared understanding that there is a disagreement;
* The well-being of the people involved needs to depend on each other in some way. This doesn’t mean that they have to have equal power: a manager and subordinate can be equally as interdependent as a married couple;
* The people involved perceive that their goals are incompatible, meaning that they cannot both be met;
* They are competing for resources; and

* Each perceives the other as interfering with the achievement of their goals.

Conflict is not always a bad thing

---

Conflict can be destructive, leading people to develop negative feelings for each other and spend energy on conflict that could be better spent elsewhere. It can also deepen differences, and lead groups to polarise into either/or positions.

However, well-managed conflict can also be constructive, helping to ‘clear the air’, releasing emotion and stress, and resolving tension, especially if those involved use it as an opportunity to increase understanding and find a way forward together out of the conflict situation.

Our pages on conflict resolution, criticism and mediation provide advice and support for dealing with conflict and other potentially difficult situations:

**01 - Conflict and Conflict Resolution**

**There are times when it is important to be able to communicate under difficult circumstances.**

While many of us would prefer to avoid difficult conversations, sometimes this is not possible. For example, a manager may have to tell someone that they are being made redundant, or a child confess to their parents that they are struggling at school.

> *Our page on [**Communication in Difficult Circumstances**](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/communication-difficult-situations.html) provides advice about how to manage these difficult conversations without creating conflict.*

Before you can start to resolve any conflict, you need to be able to understand its source, and therefore the type of conflict.

> *Our page [**Introduction to Conflict Resolution**](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/conflict-resolution.html) explains that there are three types of conflict: personal, often about values and relationships; instrumental conflicts, about how to achieve goals; and conflicts of interest. It also introduces some ideas about strategies for resolving conflicts.*

---

**02 - Complaints and Criticism**

**Complaints and criticism may not sound like they fit naturally with conflict resolution. But in real life, both complaints and criticism can be a source of considerable conflict, and knowing how to complain and criticise effectively, in a way that does not cause conflict, is a very useful interpersonal skill.**

> *Our page on [**Constructive Criticism**](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/constructive-criticism.html) provides advice about how to give criticism in a way that will enable it to be heard and acted upon, and the page on [**Dealing with Criticism**](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/dealing-with-criticism.html) explains how to hear and accept criticism calmly, even when it is not expressed constructively. You may also find our page on [**Giving and Receiving Feedback**](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/feedback.html) useful.*

> *Finally, our page on [**How to Complain (Effectively)**](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/effective-complaints.html) provides some useful rules on how to make a complaint that will be heard and acted upon, the most important of which is know what you want to achieve by complaining.*

---

**Sometimes informal conflict resolution is not enough.**

It is important to know when to step away from a conflict situation and ask someone more skilled to mediate. While most of us will not be called upon to mediate in an international conflict, or even an industrial relations problem, developing some mediation skills can be helpful when conflict has escalated beyond the normal level.

> *Our pages on [**Mediation Skills**](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/mediation-skills.html) and [**Peer Mediation**](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/peer-mediation.html) provide more information about this important area.*

Conflict is a Fact of Life
----------

**Interpersonal disagreements are a fact of life, which means that so also is interpersonal conflict.**

Learning to handle difficult situations so that they become more positive, and deal well with criticism, can help to avoid some conflict. Developing your conflict resolution and mediation skills can also help to ensure that conflict becomes a positive experience, rather than negative.

## Example (good): 
**Scenario**: A software development team, led by an inspirational leader, consistently achieves high levels of performance, innovation, and collaboration.

**Inspirational Leadership Factors**:

- **Centeredness**: The leader consistently maintains mindfulness, staying level-headed, and empathizing with the team.
- **Self-Regard**: The leader has a realistic assessment of their abilities and promotes self-confidence within the team.
- **Empowerment**: The leader encourages team members to stretch their capabilities and explore new ideas.
- **Expressiveness**: The leader clearly communicates ideas and emotions, fostering an open and collaborative environment.

**Outcome**: The software development team, under the guidance of this inspirational leader, consistently meets project deadlines and exceeds quality expectations. Team members feel motivated, valued, and engaged, leading to lower turnover rates and higher productivity. The team's innovative ideas result in the successful launch of a groundbreaking software product.

---
## Example (good): 
**Lack of Inspirational Leadership Leading to Failure in Software Production**

**Scenario**: A software development team lacks inspirational leadership, resulting in low morale, missed deadlines, and a high turnover rate.

**Issues with Leadership**:

- **Lack of Centeredness**: The team's leader is often stressed and reactive, contributing to a tense and anxious work environment.
- **Low Self-Regard**: The leader rarely acknowledges team members' contributions, leading to diminished self-confidence among team members.
- **Limited Empowerment**: Team members feel micromanaged and are not given opportunities to explore new ideas or take ownership of their work.
- **Poor Expressiveness**: The leader communicates poorly, often misunderstanding team members' concerns and failing to articulate a clear vision.

**Outcome**: The software development team faces consistent setbacks, delays, and a high rate of employee turnover. Team members become disengaged, leading to a decline in creativity and innovation. The software project ultimately fails to meet expectations, and the company loses valuable talent.


## Tips to Improve Inspirational Leadership in Software Development

- **Cultivate Centeredness**: Leaders should invest in their own mindfulness practices and stress management techniques. They should model calm and empathetic behavior to create a more relaxed work environment.
- **Boost Self-Regard**: Recognizing and celebrating individual and team achievements is crucial. Leaders should provide constructive feedback that highlights strengths and supports self-confidence.
- **Encourage Empowerment**: Leaders should delegate tasks and responsibilities to team members, allowing them to take ownership of their work and encouraging innovation. Trusting team members is essential.
- **Enhance Expressiveness**: Leaders should work on their communication skills, practicing active listening and providing clear, empathetic, and motivational communication. Regular feedback and open dialogue should be encouraged.
In both examples, the presence or absence of inspirational leadership significantly impacts the team's performance and success in software production. Inspirational leadership can motivate and empower team members, fostering a positive and innovative work environment. To improve inspirational leadership, leaders should focus on their own development, enhance their interpersonal skills, and prioritize the well-being and growth of their team members.

This is the definition of inspirational leadership

The Emotional and Social Intelligence competency of Inspirational Leadership means having the ability to inspire and guide others towards a common goal or vision, to get the job done, and to bring out their best qualities along the way. With inspiration you can connect with something meaningful, and articulate a shared mission in a way that motivates people and offers a sense of purpose beyond day-to-day tasks.

Use the content of the following article and information from web to come up with two examples where in the first good inspirational leadership results in success of a software produce and in the second lack of inspirational leadership results in failure. Give tools and tips to improve inspirational leadership
Article 
"Few rigorous methods exist to measure someone’s ability to inspire, to systematically develop that intangible quality or to embed those skills throughout an organization. As Barbara Kellerman, founding executive director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School, has observed: "Leadership as an area of intellectual inquiry remains thin, and little original thought has been given to what leader learning in the second decade of the 21st century should look like."

What does it take to foster inspiring leaders, not just through a lucky accident of talent management but year in and year out? To help answer that question, we have been conducting comprehensive research since 2013, using Bain and select clients as a test bed. Specifically, we designed an analytical approach to deﬁne, measure and develop inspirational skills. Three key questions guided our research:

* What characteristics matter when it comes to inspiring others?
* How many inspiring behaviors does someone need to demonstrate reliably in order to inspire others, and what pattern of behaviors is most powerful?
* How can we calibrate the strength of those characteristics in an individual?

While inspiration may seem difﬁcult to decipher, we identified 33 distinct and tangible attributes that are statistically signiﬁcant in creating inspiration in others. And having just four of those attributes as distinguishing strengths is sufﬁcient to make someone highly inspiring. The findings also demonstrate that people who inspire are incredibly diverse. Any combination of distinguishing strengths works: There is no ﬁxed archetype of an inspirational leader.

### The characteristics that matter ###

To understand what inspires people, we surveyed all employees, not just formal leaders or HR experts. Why? People at all levels of an organization seek inspiration. Employees can judge best what inspires them. It’s the collective voice of all those customers or followers that matters in validating which characteristics are inspiring, not what leaders say they do or what human resources managers assert is important.

Because inspiration is subjective, it helps to understand the basic shape of the analysis. Starting with an initial survey of 2,000 Bain employees, we asked respondents to rate how inspired they were by their colleagues. We also asked them to rate what was important in contributing to that sense of inspiration. To do this, we selected a list of attributes to test based on data gathered from multiple disciplines—including psychology, neurology, sociology, organizational behavior and management science—as well as extensive interviews.

Using followers’ responses, we conducted a conjoint analysis (typical in consumer research) to assess the relevance of a range of attributes contributing to respondents’ feelings of inspiration. The result was a set of 33 characteristics that are statistically signiﬁcant in inspiring others. Bain then used this set of behaviors to create the Bain Inspirational Leadership model (see Figure 1).

---

![how-leaders-inspire-fig-01_embed](https://www.bain.com/contentassets/2024cdcfe439496d99d49e84e4c489d9/how-leaders-inspire-fig-01_full.gif "how-leaders-inspire-fig-01_embed")

These 33 characteristics that inspire vary widely. Self-regard, for example, is holding a conﬁdent yet realistic assessment of one’s abilities; expressiveness is conveying ideas and emotions clearly and compellingly; and empowerment is allowing and encouraging the freedom to stretch. Other attributes may also inspire, but collectively, the 33 behaviors we identiﬁed were the most powerful in contributing to inspiration.

We grouped the characteristics that inspire into four quadrants that highlight the setting in which they tend to apply. One quadrant, for example, contains the qualities related to leading a team. Another cluster includes behaviors that develop one’s inner resources, such as stress tolerance, optimism and emotional self-awareness. While these quadrants provide a structure that makes the model easier to digest, they do not emphasize any particular distribution of abilities. Our research demonstrates that each of the elements is important to the collective inspirational health of an organization and that no combination is more powerful in contributing to an individual’s capacity to inspire. It’s not necessary to have one attribute from each quadrant to be effective.

One surprising result: [Centeredness](https://www.bainleadership.com/centeredness/) was the most important attribute. Of all the elements, centeredness was the skill that employees most wanted to develop. Centeredness is a state of greater mindfulness, achieved by engaging all parts of the mind to be fully present. While a growing number of companies offer optional mindfulness programs to promote health and workplace satisfaction, our research shows that centeredness is fundamental to the ability to lead. It improves one’s ability to stay level-headed, cope with stress, empathize with others and listen more deeply.

Centeredness is the nexus of the other 32 elements and a mandatory skill. Just as leaders need to be able to meet their performance objectives to be rated as satisfactory, for example, we recognize that leaders need to be able to stay centered to inspire. Being centered is a precondition to using one’s leadership strengths effectively.

### The most powerful combination ###

How many of these inspiring behaviors does someone need to reliably inspire others? We used our database of more than 10,000 assessments to correlate the proﬁle of strengths and weaknesses with the level of inspiration stated by an individual’s colleagues.

We deﬁned an [individual’s distinguishing strengths](https://www.bainleadership.com/individual-application/) as those that rank within the top 10% of one’s peer group. We labeled the characteristics ranked between the 70th and 90th percentiles as potential distinguishing strengths and those in the bottom 10% as weaknesses. The characteristics falling between the 10th and 70th percentiles are neutral characteristics, because one’s level of skill neither detracts from nor contributes to the differential effect on others.

The result was exciting: Even one distinguishing strength nearly doubles your chances of being inspiring—and the more distinguishing strengths you have, the more inspirational you can be. In fact, more than 90% of those demonstrating distinguishing strengths on four or more of the 32 elements are inspirational to their colleagues (see Figure 2). That ﬁnding underscores the power of authenticity: No combination of strengths is statistically more powerful than any other. Inspirational leaders come in many varieties.

![how-leaders-inspire-fig-02_embed](https://www.bain.com/contentassets/2024cdcfe439496d99d49e84e4c489d9/how-leaders-inspire-fig-02_full.gif "how-leaders-inspire-fig-02_embed")

The key developmental insight from these ﬁndings is that an individual can increase his or her inspirational leadership ability by excelling at just a handful of intrinsic strengths and converting weaknesses to neutral. The data also shows that it’s more effective to develop a distinguishing strength than to neutralize a weakness: On average, investing in adding a distinguishing strength is one and a half times more powerful at building inspiration than neutralizing a weakness.

### Calibrating a strength ###

Why create a leadership program focused overwhelmingly on strengths? A growing body of research has shown that encouraging people to bolster their strengths is more effective than striving to ﬁx their weaknesses. According to Gallup research, the odds of employees being engaged are 73% when an organization’s leadership focuses on the strengths of its employees vs. 9% when they do not.

"One of the things we know is that when things are negative, people see fewer options, [and] they’re less able to problem solve. It shuts down the brain," said business psychologist Jennifer Thompson, an associate professor at the Chicago School of Professional Psychology. "When people have positive environments, they’re more creative. They’re more productive."

Since inspiration is relevant to every employee, calibrating an individual’s strengths requires feedback from above, below and across the organization. To rate a person’s strength on a given attribute, we developed a 360-degree assessment based on the views of coworkers at every level. This customer input is then compared with an individual’s peers’ results to figure out his or her relative strength. Understanding where one stands out from the pack based on distinguishing strengths helps each individual deﬁne his or her [leadership brand](https://www.bainleadership.com/leadership-brand/) and use it more effectively in daily interactions.

Anyone can start developing the ability to inspire by discovering and cultivating his or her inherent talents. Bain’s Inspirational Leadership System includes structured reflection, input from 360-degree surveys and self-assessments. Each employee selects four or ﬁve characteristics out of the 32 based on their existing strengths and what feels authentic. That combination of skills becomes one’s "rock pile," or inspirational leadership brand—something each person can target for personal development and use on a daily basis.

[

Bain research identified 33 distinguishing characteristics of inspirational leaders. Having any four strengths can make you exceptional.

### Building an organization that inspires ###

Typical leadership programs target a limited number of people within an organization—the traditional constituencies of senior executives and high potentials. Those who are excluded, including the vast majority of employees, never get a chance to develop their skills. But to function as a true system and build inspiration into an organization’s ways of working, leadership programs need to reach deeper. And the sooner people get started, the stronger and more valuable their skills will be as they rise in the organization.

The majority of our employees use Bain’s Inspirational Leadership System, and the goal is to reach every employee. The number of colleagues cited as inspirational grew by 18% between 2014 and 2015, and their inﬂuence is spreading: The percentage of employees who describe themselves as "inspired" has grown since the start of the program, along with corresponding measures of employee engagement and the strength of Bain’s culture, according to Bain’s Net Promoter System®.

Of course, Bain is not alone in its quest to understand what sets inspiring leaders apart. Many companies are experimenting with programs of their own. Aetna, for example, has implemented a companywide focus on mindfulness, sponsored by its CEO. And Telefonica Germany has launched empathy training for its employees in an effort to improve customer satisfaction. These types of programs are valuable, but many stop short of achieving their full potential. Our research shows a more comprehensive, analytical approach can create a powerful system that increases inspiration throughout an organization.

As the nature of work grows increasingly collaborative and self-directed, inspiration can make the difference between teams that outperform and those that lag. Leadership systems that systematically build inspiration work because, at their essence, they honor the complexity of human relationships, foster authenticity and create a common platform for every individual to make unique contributions. Companies that tap into that powerful combination will gain a competitive advantage that few can match.

Where does focus belong in the emotional intelligence competencies

ChatGPT

Emotional intelligence (EI) competencies encompass a range of skills and abilities related to understanding and managing emotions, both in oneself and in others. These competencies can be divided into four main categories, and the focus within each category can vary depending on the context and specific EI model being used. However, here's a general breakdown of where focus typically belongs in the emotional intelligence competencies:

1. **Self-Awareness:**
    
    - **Emotional Awareness:** Focus here involves recognizing and understanding your own emotions, including the ability to identify specific feelings and their triggers.
    - **Self-Reflection:** Focus also includes the capacity for introspection and self-examination to gain insights into your emotional reactions and behavior.
2. **Self-Management:**
    
    - **Emotion Regulation:** Focus in this area is on the ability to control and manage your own emotions effectively, including strategies for managing stress, anger, and other strong emotions.
    - **Adaptability:** Focus here involves being flexible and adaptable in response to changing circumstances, which often requires emotional resilience.
    - **Self-Motivation:** Focus also includes maintaining a high level of motivation and commitment even in the face of setbacks or challenges.
3. **Social Awareness:**
    
    - **Empathy:** Focus in this category centers on the ability to understand and tune into the emotions of others, including recognizing their feelings and perspectives.
    - **Cultural Awareness:** In some contexts, particularly in diverse environments, the focus may extend to understanding and respecting cultural and emotional differences.
    - **Situational Awareness:** Focus also includes being attuned to the emotional climate of a group or organization, which can help in decision-making and relationship-building.
4. **Relationship Management:**
    
    - **Communication:** Focus here is on effective communication, including active listening and clear expression of thoughts and feelings.
    - **Conflict Resolution:** Focus may extend to resolving conflicts and managing difficult conversations with empathy and tact.
    - **Influence:** Focus also includes the ability to positively influence and inspire others, often through the effective management of emotions and relationships.
    - **Teamwork and Collaboration:** In group settings, the focus may involve fostering teamwork and collaboration by creating an emotionally supportive environment.

It's important to note that these competencies are interconnected and can overlap. The specific focus within each competency may vary based on individual strengths, weaknesses, and the particular situations or goals someone is addressing. Developing emotional intelligence often involves continuous self-awareness and ongoing efforts to improve in all these areas to enhance interpersonal relationships, leadership abilities, and overall emotional well-being.

Is focus part of the emotional intellgience

Yes, focus is indeed a part of emotional intelligence (EI). While focus itself is not typically listed as one of the core components of EI, it is an important skill that contributes to several aspects of emotional intelligence, particularly in the areas of self-awareness and self-management.

Here's how focus relates to emotional intelligence:

1. **Self-Awareness:** Focus is essential for recognizing and understanding your own emotions. To develop emotional self-awareness, you need the ability to concentrate on your feelings, thoughts, and reactions. This kind of introspection and self-examination requires focus and mindfulness to recognize and interpret your emotional states accurately.
    
2. **Self-Management:** Emotional self-regulation, a key component of self-management in EI, involves controlling and managing your own emotions effectively. To do this, you must be able to concentrate on your emotions in the moment and apply strategies to manage them constructively. Focus helps you redirect your attention away from negative emotions and toward healthier responses.
    
3. **Empathy:** Focus also plays a role in empathy, a vital aspect of social awareness in emotional intelligence. To understand and tune into the emotions of others, you must be able to focus on their words, body language, and non-verbal cues. Active listening, a skill associated with empathy, relies on maintaining focus during conversations to truly understand what others are saying and feeling.
    

In summary, while focus is not explicitly listed as one of the main components of EI, it is an underlying skill that supports various aspects of emotional intelligence. Developing the ability to focus on your own emotions, the emotions of others, and the context in which emotions arise can contribute significantly to your overall emotional intelligence.

## Example

**Example 1: Successful Product Delivery with Organizational Awareness**

_Scenario_: A tech company is working on a critical project with tight deadlines. The project involves multiple teams, each responsible for different aspects of development. The project manager, Alex, possesses strong organizational awareness.

**How Organizational Awareness Led to Success**:

- **Identifying Key Influencers**: Alex recognized that one of the lead software engineers, Sarah, held a significant informal power position within the development team. By building a strong working relationship with Sarah, Alex ensured that critical decisions related to software architecture and development were aligned with the project's goals.
    
- **Navigating Hidden Landmines**: Alex was aware of past conflicts between the user interface (UI) design team and the development team. Instead of ignoring this history, Alex initiated open communication between the teams, addressing past issues and setting clear expectations. This prevented potential conflicts and ensured a smooth collaboration.
    
- **Leveraging Emotional Climate**: Sensing that team morale was lower than usual due to the project's intensity, Alex organized team-building activities and acknowledged the team's efforts. This boosted team morale and commitment to the project.
    
- **Networking Opportunities**: Recognizing the importance of external partnerships, Alex attended industry conferences and met with potential business partners. This expanded the project's reach and secured additional resources.
    

**Example 2: Hindered Progress Due to Lack of Organizational Awareness**

_Scenario_: Another tech company is working on a similar project, but this time the project manager, Mark, lacks organizational awareness.

**How the Lack of Organizational Awareness Hindered Progress**:

- **Overlooking Key Influencers**: Mark underestimated the influence of the software architect, Emily, assuming her role was purely technical. Emily had valuable insights into the project's technical feasibility, but Mark did not consult her. This led to technical issues and project delays.
    
- **Ignoring Unspoken Rules**: Mark was unaware of the unspoken rule that team members valued a flexible work schedule. He enforced rigid working hours, leading to frustration and decreased productivity among team members.
    
- **Neglecting Emotional Climate**: Mark failed to notice the increasing stress levels among team members. As a result, he did not provide the necessary support or resources to alleviate their stress, resulting in burnout and increased absenteeism.
    

**Tips to Improve Organizational Awareness for Individual Contributors**:

- **Observe Workplace Dynamics**: Pay attention to how different teams and individuals interact within the organization. Notice power dynamics, communication patterns, and alliances.
    
- **Seek Feedback**: Ask colleagues or mentors for their insights into the organization's dynamics. They may provide valuable perspectives you haven't considered.
    
- **Develop Empathy**: Work on understanding the emotions and motivations of your colleagues and superiors. This can help you navigate interpersonal relationships effectively.
    

**Tips to Improve Organizational Awareness for Managers/Leaders**:

- **Promote Open Communication**: Encourage transparent and open communication within your teams. Create a culture where employees feel comfortable sharing their observations and concerns.
    
- **Mentoring and Coaching**: Provide coaching and mentoring opportunities for your team members to enhance their awareness of organizational dynamics.
    
- **Networking**: Attend industry events, conferences, and meetings to expand your network and gain insights into industry trends and partnerships.
    

**Books and Podcasts to Improve Organizational Awareness**:

- **Book**: "Emotional Intelligence" by Daniel Goleman - This book provides a comprehensive overview of emotional intelligence, including organizational awareness.
    
- **Book**: "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team" by Patrick Lencioni - This book explores team dynamics and the role of leadership in building a cohesive team.

Which tech leads and software engineers talked about organizational awareness

## prompt 2 
This is the definition of the organizational awareness

"Organizational Awareness is an Emotional and Social Intelligence Leadership Competency. It means having the ability to read a group's emotional currents and power relationships, and identify influencers, networks, and dynamics within the organization. Leaders who can recognize networking opportunities and read key power relationships are better equipped to navigate the demands of their leadership role."

Based on the theory of emotional intelligent, resources at your disposal, and the following article come up with two examples for tech industry where in the first example  use of organizational awareness lead to a successful product delivery and one where that lack of organizational awareness hindered progress. Make the examples realistic and scenario based. Then give tops for individual contributors and managers/leaders to improve their organizational awareness. Introduce books and podcasts that they can use to improve organizational awareness competency

Article:
Some leaders seem to have ESP. With a little effort, these businesspeople can sus out an organization’s unwritten rules, the necessary steps to get things done, its hidden landmines, and the person, or people, who have considerably more power than their titles suggest.

But it only seems like some otherworldly sixth sense. It’s actually an overlooked skill called [organizational awareness](https://www.kornferry.com/institute/organizational-awareness-leadership) that can help in-touch leaders not only understand the forces at work within an organization, but also the guiding values and unspoken rules that operate among its people. Most leaders take their level of this ability as a given, not realizing the ability to recognize networking opportunities and read key power relationships is a talent they can develop. As with all the [emotional intelligence competencies](https://www.kornferry.com/institute/emotional-intelligence-employee-retention-leadership-style), there are strategies for strengthening organizational awareness.    

First, it requires a foundation of [self-awareness](https://www.kornferry.com/institute/what-is-emotional-self-awareness). This tells us not only the impact of our emotions and actions on our performance. As importantly, it puts us in touch with the guiding, but hidden, norms for behaving in our organization and helps us sense the dynamics of the system within the organization. 

To move from self-awareness to organizational awareness, begin by observing workplace dynamics and ask yourself the following questions:

- How do the parts of this organization fit together?
- Does the organization have a mission statement? If so, is it reflected in day to day realities?
- What are the norms, both spoken or unspoken?
- What is the emotional climate and why?
- Are people engaged and passionate about their work?
- How does the organization relate to business partners and competitors?
- Where is there tension in the organization, and what is causing it?
- What are the social networks within the organization? Who talks to whom? Who holds informal power? Who does key information pass through? To whom do people listen? 

Compare your answers to how other people read the organization. You can ask the same questions of a colleague or anyone you know whom you think has a knack for awareness of the organization’s systems. You can even do this as an awareness drill with your team, running through these queries to sharpen your group’s interactions with other parts of the company.

This organizational awareness goes hand-in-hand with the competence called [“influence.”](https://www.kornferry.com/institute/influence-emotional-intelligence) For instance, once you have a clear sense of who the decision-makers are for an initiative you care about, you can target them. Your goal: face time with each, which might require a bit of networking on your part. But face time gives you the chance to make the arguments that might persuade them to take your point of view.

Here another emotional intelligence competence will help: [empathy](https://www.kornferry.com/institute/empathy-emotional-intelligence-business-skill), which gives us an accurate perception of other peoples’ emotions and motives, as well as how best to put things to them in the moment. You can sense, for instance, when some data might help, or when a powerful story might make the point even better.

Before you meet with the decision-makers, do a bit of research on their background, interests, duties and such will give you points of connection. Once you connect and build a rapport, you can pitch.

The ability to read key relationships and understand people’s motivations and goals is essential for building buy-in for your ideas. Strengthening your organizational awareness will help set you up for success as you turn your newfound insights into pointed actions.

## Self awareness
### 1 Emotional Self awareness
Emotional Self-Awareness is the capacity to tune into your own feelings, sense inner signals, and recognize how your feelings affect you and your performance. It is an important skill for leadership at any level, as well as many aspects of life.

The purpose of developing Emotional Self-Awareness is that it allows us to understand how our bodily sensations and our emotions impact ourselves, others, and our environment. Each moment is an opportunity to be self-aware. Thus, the more we practice it, the more proficient we become and the greater our capacity to recognize the space between stimuli and our response to that stimuli, ensuring a more conscious and skillful approach.

Without Emotional Self-Awareness, it is difficult to become proficient in and consistently use the other Emotional and Social Intelligence Competencies.

## Self control###
### 2 Emotional Self control
Emotional Self-Control is the ability to keep disruptive emotions and impulses in check, and to maintain your effectiveness under stressful or even hostile conditions.

It's also something that can differentiate great leaders from those with whom it is difficult to work.

Instead of suppressing our emotions, we take notice of them as they emerge, mentally naming or noting them, along with any bodily signals that may accompany how we are feeling in the moment. Having Emotional Self-Control means staying clear-headed and calm, balancing one's impulses and feelings for the good of the group, or for the good of a given task, mission, or vision.

### 3 Adaptability
Adaptability is an Emotional and Social Intelligence Leadership Competency that entails having the flexibility to handle change, balance multiple demands, and adapt to new situations with fresh ideas.

An adaptable leader can meet challenges as they arise and adjust strategy or style based on what is needed most. They are not halted by sudden change, remaining comfortable with the uncertainty that leadership can bring.

While adaptability involves changing to manage under new conditions, resilience, through 'bouncing back', implies the ability to revert to a previous, more positive state, after experiencing some difficulty or challenge. This is what, by definition, separates adaptability from resilience. (Ref [Resilience v adaptability - InnerDrive Blogs](https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/resilience-v-adaptability#:~:text=While%20adaptability%20involves%20changing%20to,definition%2C%20separates%20adaptability%20from%20resilience.)


What is the relationship between resilience and adaptability?

Adaptability implies a sense of personal choice, of purposefully navigating—rather than being driven by—changing circumstances. Resilience is the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties. Resilience gives you the ability to bounce forward with new insights and learning you can carry into the future.

### 4 Achievement Orientation
Achievement Orientation is an Emotional and Social Intelligence Leadership Competency that entails striving to meet or exceed a standard of excellence, appreciating feedback on our performance, and continually seeking ways to do things better.

There is more to consider with this competency beyond the simple motivation for rewards. A leader who has a high capacity for this competency is able to balance his or her personal drive with the needs of the organization as a whole. That involves self-management, relationship management, and understanding the context of a given situation.

### Coach and Mentor 
The Emotional Intelligence competency we call Coach and Mentor is the ability to foster the long-term learning or development of others by giving feedback and support. The Coach and Mentor competency is an essential social competency for leaders at any level in an organization.

The International Coach Federation (ICF) defines a set of core coaching competencies that professional coaches should possess to effectively work with their clients. These competencies help coaches facilitate meaningful and transformative coaching relationships. Here are the ICF coaching competencies with definitions and examples for each:

1. **Setting the Foundation**:
    
    - **Coaching Agreement**: Coaches establish a clear agreement with the client regarding the coaching relationship, including roles, responsibilities, and goals.
        
        - _Example_: A coach and client agree on the coaching schedule, fees, and confidentiality before starting the coaching engagement.
    - **Ethical Guidelines and Professional Standards**: Coaches uphold the ICF's ethical guidelines and professional standards throughout the coaching process.
        
        - _Example_: A coach maintains strict confidentiality and avoids any conflicts of interest in their coaching practice.
2. **Co-Creating the Relationship**:
    
    - **Establishing Trust and Intimacy with the Client**: Coaches build a safe and trusting environment where the client feels comfortable sharing and exploring.
        
        - _Example_: A coach listens empathetically to a client's concerns and validates their feelings, creating an atmosphere of trust.
    - **Coaching Presence**: Coaches remain fully present and engaged with the client, focusing on their needs and priorities.
        
        - _Example_: A coach is attentive, non-judgmental, and open-minded during coaching sessions, providing undivided attention to the client.
3. **Communicating Effectively**:
    
    - **Active Listening**: Coaches actively listen to what the client is saying, both verbally and non-verbally, and ask powerful questions to explore deeper.
        
        - _Example_: A coach reflects the client's words and emotions, saying, "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated about the project delays. Can you tell me more?"
    - **Powerful Questioning**: Coaches ask open-ended questions that encourage self-discovery and help the client gain clarity.
        
        - _Example_: A coach asks, "What do you believe is the underlying cause of these recurring challenges you're facing in your career?"
    - **Direct Communication**: Coaches use clear and direct language to convey observations and insights.
        
        - _Example_: A coach provides straightforward feedback when a client's actions don't align with their stated goals.
4. **Facilitating Learning and Results**:
    
    - **Creating Awareness**: Coaches assist clients in gaining insight and awareness about their thoughts, behaviors, and potential actions.
        
        - _Example_: A coach helps a client recognize that their fear of public speaking stems from a past experience, enabling them to address it.
    - **Designing Actions**: Coaches collaborate with clients to create specific, achievable action plans that align with their goals.
        
        - _Example_: A coach works with a client to develop a step-by-step plan to improve time management skills, helping them meet project deadlines.
    - **Planning and Goal Setting**: Coaches support clients in setting meaningful goals and defining a clear path to achieve them.
        
        - _Example_: A coach helps a client set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals for career advancement.
5. **Cultivating Trust and Safety**:
    
    - **Maintaining Trust**: Coaches uphold the client's trust by consistently delivering on commitments and maintaining confidentiality.
        
        - _Example_: A coach keeps client information confidential, even when discussing their progress with a mentor or supervisor.
    - **Creating a Safe Space**: Coaches ensure that the coaching relationship provides a non-judgmental and secure environment for the client.
        
        - _Example_: A coach assures the client that their coaching sessions are a judgment-free zone where they can openly explore their challenges.
6. **Evaluating and Providing Feedback**:
    
    - **Feedback and Accountability**: Coaches provide constructive feedback and hold clients accountable for their commitments.
        - _Example_: A coach gently reminds a client of their agreed-upon action plan and discusses any missed commitments to help them stay on track.

These coaching competencies serve as a framework for coaches to guide their coaching practice and help clients achieve their desired outcomes. Effective coaches continuously develop and refine these competencies to provide valuable coaching experiences for their clients.

The International Coach Federation (ICF) defines a set of core coaching competencies that professional coaches should possess to effectively work with their clients. These competencies help coaches facilitate meaningful and transformative coaching relationships. Here are the ICF coaching competencies with definitions and examples for each:

1. **Setting the Foundation**:
    
    - **Coaching Agreement**: Coaches establish a clear agreement with the client regarding the coaching relationship, including roles, responsibilities, and goals.
        
        - _Example_: A coach and client agree on the coaching schedule, fees, and confidentiality before starting the coaching engagement.
    - **Ethical Guidelines and Professional Standards**: Coaches uphold the ICF's ethical guidelines and professional standards throughout the coaching process.
        
        - _Example_: A coach maintains strict confidentiality and avoids any conflicts of interest in their coaching practice.
2. **Co-Creating the Relationship**:
    
    - **Establishing Trust and Intimacy with the Client**: Coaches build a safe and trusting environment where the client feels comfortable sharing and exploring.
        
        - _Example_: A coach listens empathetically to a client's concerns and validates their feelings, creating an atmosphere of trust.
    - **Coaching Presence**: Coaches remain fully present and engaged with the client, focusing on their needs and priorities.
        
        - _Example_: A coach is attentive, non-judgmental, and open-minded during coaching sessions, providing undivided attention to the client.
3. **Communicating Effectively**:
    
    - **Active Listening**: Coaches actively listen to what the client is saying, both verbally and non-verbally, and ask powerful questions to explore deeper.
        
        - _Example_: A coach reflects the client's words and emotions, saying, "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated about the project delays. Can you tell me more?"
    - **Powerful Questioning**: Coaches ask open-ended questions that encourage self-discovery and help the client gain clarity.
        
        - _Example_: A coach asks, "What do you believe is the underlying cause of these recurring challenges you're facing in your career?"
    - **Direct Communication**: Coaches use clear and direct language to convey observations and insights.
        
        - _Example_: A coach provides straightforward feedback when a client's actions don't align with their stated goals.
4. **Facilitating Learning and Results**:
    
    - **Creating Awareness**: Coaches assist clients in gaining insight and awareness about their thoughts, behaviors, and potential actions.
        
        - _Example_: A coach helps a client recognize that their fear of public speaking stems from a past experience, enabling them to address it.
    - **Designing Actions**: Coaches collaborate with clients to create specific, achievable action plans that align with their goals.
        
        - _Example_: A coach works with a client to develop a step-by-step plan to improve time management skills, helping them meet project deadlines.
    - **Planning and Goal Setting**: Coaches support clients in setting meaningful goals and defining a clear path to achieve them.
        
        - _Example_: A coach helps a client set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals for career advancement.
5. **Cultivating Trust and Safety**:
    
    - **Maintaining Trust**: Coaches uphold the client's trust by consistently delivering on commitments and maintaining confidentiality.
        
        - _Example_: A coach keeps client information confidential, even when discussing their progress with a mentor or supervisor.
    - **Creating a Safe Space**: Coaches ensure that the coaching relationship provides a non-judgmental and secure environment for the client.
        
        - _Example_: A coach assures the client that their coaching sessions are a judgment-free zone where they can openly explore their challenges.
6. **Evaluating and Providing Feedback**:
    
    - **Feedback and Accountability**: Coaches provide constructive feedback and hold clients accountable for their commitments.
        - _Example_: A coach gently reminds a client of their agreed-upon action plan and discusses any missed commitments to help them stay on track.

These coaching competencies serve as a framework for coaches to guide their coaching practice and help clients achieve their desired outcomes. Effective coaches continuously develop and refine these competencies to provide valuable coaching experiences for their clients.

===============================

### Influence
Influence is a social competency necessary for any leadership style. It can be done in a way that is meaningful and effective, or fraught with resistance. Leaders competent in Influence will gather support from others with relative ease, creating a group who is engaged, mobilized, and ready to execute on the tasks at hand.

- 3 Detailed, High-Level Examples of Applied Influence
- How to Develop Influence
- Teams, Emotional Intelligence, and Influence
- Influence and Leader Performance
- Cultivating Influence Through Executive Coaching


The Influence Competency in Emotional Intelligence (EI) refers to an individual's ability to effectively impact and persuade others while maintaining positive relationships and cooperation. It involves using interpersonal skills and emotional awareness to inspire, motivate, and guide others toward a common goal or decision.

The Influence Competency is closely related to several other EI competencies and plays a vital role in overall emotional intelligence:

1. **Emotional Awareness**: Before influencing others, individuals must be aware of their own emotions and the emotions of those they are interacting with. Emotional awareness provides the foundation for understanding how emotions influence decisions and behaviors.
    
2. **Empathy**: Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. It is essential in the influence competency because it enables individuals to connect with others on an emotional level, which is often key to persuasive communication.
    
3. **Communication Skills**: Effective communication is a core component of influence. It involves not only the words spoken but also non-verbal cues and active listening. Strong communication skills enhance one's ability to convey ideas and inspire others.
    
4. **Conflict Management**: The influence competency often comes into play when resolving conflicts or disagreements. Individuals with strong influence skills can navigate conflicts by tactfully addressing differences and finding common ground.
    
5. **Leadership**: Leadership and influence go hand in hand. Effective leaders use their influence competency to motivate and guide their teams, fostering collaboration and achieving shared goals.
    
6. **Teamwork and Collaboration**: In a team setting, individuals with strong influence skills can build trust and cooperation, ensuring that team members work harmoniously toward common objectives.
    
7. **Decision Making**: Influence can play a role in decision-making processes. Individuals who can effectively influence others may have an impact on the decisions made within a group or organization.
    
8. **Stress Management**: Managing one's own stress and helping others cope with stress is essential in influence. High-stress situations can hinder effective communication and persuasion.
    

The Influence Competency is particularly important in leadership roles, sales and marketing, negotiations, and any situation where one needs to persuade others to take specific actions or adopt particular viewpoints.

## examples
**Example 1: Successful Use of Influence Competency in a Software Project**

In this scenario, a software project manager effectively applies influence competency, resulting in a successful outcome:

_Context_: A software development project is underway, and the team faces a critical decision regarding the choice of a new technology stack to improve performance and scalability.

**Successful Outcome:**

- **Influence Competency in Action**: The project manager, John, identifies that team members have varying opinions on the choice of technology stack. Instead of imposing his own preference, he actively listens to the team's concerns and perspectives. He then utilizes his influence competency to guide the team toward a collaborative decision.
    
- **Building Trust**: John fosters an environment of trust by acknowledging the team's expertise and acknowledging their concerns about the technology stack. He communicates that their opinions are valued.
    
- **Effective Communication**: John employs effective communication by presenting a detailed analysis of the pros and cons of each technology stack option. He uses non-confrontational language and encourages team members to express their thoughts openly.
    
- **Empathy**: John demonstrates empathy by understanding the team's fears and reservations about adopting new technology. He addresses these concerns by proposing a gradual transition plan and providing support for skill development.
    
- **Conflict Resolution**: When conflicts arise within the team regarding the technology choice, John intervenes to facilitate constructive discussions. He ensures that team members focus on the common goal of project success.
    
- **Consensus Building**: Through patient discussions and compromise, John guides the team toward a consensus on the technology stack choice that aligns with the project's goals and objectives.
    
- **Positive Outcome**: The team eventually adopts the agreed-upon technology stack, and the project progresses successfully. Performance and scalability improve as intended, and team morale remains high due to their involvement in the decision-making process.
    

**Example 2: Failure Due to Lack of Influence Competency**

In this scenario, a software project encounters difficulties because of a lack of influence competency:

_Context_: A software development team is working on a project with a tight deadline. The team leader, Sarah, lacks influence competency and struggles to manage the team effectively.

**Failure Outcome:**

- **Lack of Influence Competency**: Sarah fails to effectively influence and guide the team. She makes unilateral decisions without considering the team's input, leading to frustration and disengagement among team members.
- **Poor Communication**: Sarah communicates directives in a top-down manner, without explaining the rationale behind decisions. This lack of communication leaves team members feeling disconnected and demotivated.
- **Lack of Empathy**: Sarah does not demonstrate empathy towards the team's challenges and concerns. She dismisses their issues as unimportant and fails to address their emotional needs.
- **Conflict Escalation**: When conflicts arise within the team, Sarah does not intervene effectively. Instead, she allows conflicts to escalate, creating a hostile and unproductive work environment.
- **Low Morale**: Team morale plummets due to Sarah's approach, resulting in increased absenteeism and turnover. Team members lose faith in the project's success.
- **Missed Deadlines**: The lack of team cohesion and motivation leads to missed project milestones and a failure to meet the tight deadline.

**Tips to Improve Influence Competency for Individual Contributors:**

- **Active Listening**: Actively listen to colleagues' perspectives and concerns without interrupting. Make an effort to understand their viewpoints.
- **Effective Communication**: Clearly and persuasively articulate your ideas and proposals. Use non-confrontational language and avoid jargon.
- **Empathy**: Put yourself in others' shoes to understand their emotions and concerns. Show genuine interest in their well-being.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Learn conflict resolution techniques to address disagreements constructively and seek win-win solutions.

**Tips to Improve Influence Competency for Managers and Leaders:**

- **Lead by Example**: Demonstrate effective influence competency in your interactions with the team. Model the behaviors you expect.
- **Build Trust**: Foster trust among team members by keeping commitments, maintaining confidentiality, and being consistent in your actions.
- **Empower Others**: Encourage team members to voice their opinions and ideas. Make them feel valued and heard.
- **Conflict Management Training**: Provide training and resources for conflict management and resolution to help team members handle conflicts effectively.
- **Feedback**: Seek feedback from your team on your leadership style and areas for improvement. Act on constructive feedback to enhance your influence competency.

Fostering a growth mindset within your team can lead to increased motivation, learning, and adaptability. Growth-focused questions can be a powerful tool in achieving this. Here are five solutions along with references to research, podcasts, books, and publications that support the idea that asking growth questions can help people develop a growth mindset:

1. **Encourage Reflection**:

    - **Research**: The benefits of reflection and self-assessment on learning and mindset are discussed in "Mindset: The New Psychology of Success" by Carol S. Dweck.
        
2. **Emphasize Effort and Persistence**:
    
    - **Solution**: Ask questions that highlight the importance of effort and persistence. For instance, "What strategies did you use to overcome obstacles in this task, and how can you apply them to other challenges?"
        
    - **Research**: Carol S. Dweck's work on the growth mindset emphasizes the significance of effort and resilience. You can find related research articles in academic journals.

    - **Book**: "Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance" by Angela Duckworth discusses the importance of embracing mistakes as opportunities for growth.
        
5. **Encourage Feedback and Development**:
    
    - **Solution**: Regularly ask team members for feedback on their own and others' work. Questions like, "What feedback can you provide to help your colleague improve, and how can you receive feedback to enhance your own skills?"
        
    - **Publication**: The Harvard Business Review often publishes articles on the benefits of feedback and its role in developing a growth mindset.
        

It's important to create a safe and supportive environment where team members feel comfortable discussing their experiences, challenges, and opportunities for growth.

/Users/atamjidi/Desktop/mywork/pkm_md/03 - Areas/Learn/EI Teaching/Coaching/Question framing.md
===============================


Research in behavioral economics has found that slight changes in a question's wording can have a big impact on people's choices. This is called the ‘framing effect’. Today we’ll look at ways to effectively reword your questions to resonate with your team. 
**The natural way to ask questions is to be clear and straightforward.** Sometimes your questions can have even more impact by flipping them in an unexpected way. Let's look at a few examples... 
1. Reverse the focus of a question to uncover a new perspective. 
- Rather than asking: "What are we doing to achieve our goal?" 
- Flip it to: "What are we ‘not’ doing to achieve our goal?" 
This framing can prompt a person to think of gaps in their thinking and highlight blindspots. 
2. Introduce outrageous constraints to disrupt formulaic responses. 
- Rather than asking: "What do we need to do to achieve our goal in 6 months time?" 
- Flip it to: "If we only had one week to achieve our 6 month goal, what would we do?" 
This framing can prompt a person to think of high impact opportunities that are often missed in longer term planning. 
3. Connect emotionally to your future self. 
- Rather than asking: "What can you change about your current approach?" 
- Flip it to: "What advice do you think your future self would give you now?" 
Framing a question like this means you don't need to wait until after an event to benefit from hindsight. 

## What are question forming strategies can help with coaching
Effective questioning is a fundamental skill in coaching and can help individuals gain new insights, shift perspectives, and explore solutions. The strategies you've mentioned, such as using the framing effect, are excellent techniques for coaching. Here are some additional question forming strategies that can be helpful in coaching:

1. **Open-Ended Questions:** Instead of asking yes/no or leading questions, use open-ended questions that encourage exploration and elaboration. For example:
    
    - "What thoughts come to mind when you consider this challenge?"
    - "Can you describe the situation in more detail?"
2. **Clarifying Questions:** When faced with vague or ambiguous responses, ask for clarification to deepen the understanding of the issue. For example:
    
    - "Could you give me an example?"
    - "Can you explain what you mean by that?"
3. **Scaling Questions:** Use scaling questions to gauge the intensity or progress of a situation. This can help individuals assess where they are and where they want to be. For example:
    
    - "On a scale of 1 to 10, how satisfied are you with your current work-life balance?"
    - "Where do you see yourself on this scale in six months?"
4. **Miracle Question:** Encourage individuals to envision a future where their problems are solved. This can help them identify their goals and motivations. For example:
    
    - "If you woke up tomorrow, and your biggest challenge was miraculously resolved, what would be different?"
    - "What small steps could you take today to move closer to that ideal future?"
5. **Reflective Questions:** Use reflective questions to help individuals explore their feelings, thoughts, and assumptions. For example:
    
    - "How do you feel about the options we've discussed?"
    - "What does success mean to you in this context?"
6. **Empowering Questions:** Encourage individuals to take ownership and responsibility for their actions and decisions. For example:
    
    - "What steps can you take to address this issue?"
    - "How can you leverage your strengths in this situation?"
7. **Socratic Questions:** These are thought-provoking questions that guide individuals to think critically and solve problems on their own. For example:
    
    - "What do you think is the underlying cause of this challenge?"
    - "What are the potential consequences of each option you're considering?"
8. **Future-Oriented Questions:** Help individuals focus on their desired outcomes and goals. For example:
    
    - "What would success look like for you in the next six months?"
    - "What steps can you take to move toward that vision?"
9. **Appreciative Inquiry:** This approach involves asking questions that focus on strengths, successes, and positive experiences to inspire change and growth. For example:
    
    - "Tell me about a time when you felt most engaged and motivated at work. What was happening?"
    - "What strengths did you utilize during that successful project?"
10. **Follow-Up Questions:** Continuously ask follow-up questions to delve deeper into a topic, explore emotions, or challenge assumptions. For example:
    
    - "Can you tell me more about why you feel that way?"
    - "What would happen if you tried a different approach?"

Remember that effective coaching involves active listening, empathy, and adaptability in your questioning approach. Tailor your questions to the individual's needs and the context of the coaching session to foster meaningful conversations and insights.
