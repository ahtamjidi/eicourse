# **Module 11 ‚Äì Teamwork**

## **üåü Introduction & Context**

**Teamwork** is the Emotional and Social Intelligence competency that enables people to work together toward a shared goal. It involves active participation, sharing responsibility and rewards, and contributing to the group‚Äôs collective capability. Effective teams build open communication, trust, psychological safety and a sense of pride and identity. When done well, teamwork generates results that are greater than the sum of individual efforts.

**Mindfulness moment (2 minutes)** ‚Äì Close your eyes and recall a time when you felt truly part of a team. What behaviours made you feel included and valued? How did collaboration feel in your body? Take a few breaths to relive that sense of connection. Let it guide your intention for this module.

### **Why Teamwork Matters**

Research on high‚Äëperforming teams shows that they sustain performance over time, bounce back from adversity and maintain the energy and resources needed for future success[leadershipnow.com](https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/2021/01/teams_that_work.html#:~:text=The%20authors%20say%20three%20components,resources%20needed%20for%20future%20success). Teams that crumble under pressure or cannot recover quickly are not effective[leadershipnow.com](https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/2021/01/teams_that_work.html#:~:text=Fairweather%20teams%20that%20crumble%20when,quickly%20are%20not%20effective%20teams). For teams to succeed they need the right people, clear and timely communication, a shared understanding of goals, supportive conditions, coordinated behaviours, cooperation built on trust and psychological safety, and coaching/leadership[leadershipnow.com](https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/2021/01/teams_that_work.html#:~:text=The%20authors%20then%20get%20into,that%20consistently%20make%20a%20difference). When any of these drivers are weak, teams struggle to deliver results and often experience conflict, disengagement or burnout.

## **üéØ Learning Objectives**

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* **Describe the seven drivers of effective teamwork** (capability, communication, cognition, conditions, coordination, cooperation, coaching) and assess your team against them[leadershipnow.com](https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/2021/01/teams_that_work.html#:~:text=The%20authors%20then%20get%20into,that%20consistently%20make%20a%20difference).

* **Identify your own teamwork strengths and blind spots**, including habits that either facilitate or hinder collaboration.

* **Build psychological safety** by reducing defensiveness, addressing microaggressions and fostering inclusive behaviour.

* **Adopt daily and weekly practices** to improve communication, shared understanding and mutual support.

* **Leverage diversity** by understanding different personalities, cultures and perspectives.

* **Coach and be coached** within your team‚Äîhelp peers remove obstacles, clarify roles and cultivate a growth mindset.

## **üß† Science Snapshot: Drivers of Team Effectiveness**

Scott Tannenbaum and Eduardo Salas synthesised decades of team research into **seven drivers of team effectiveness**[leadershipnow.com](https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/2021/01/teams_that_work.html#:~:text=The%20authors%20then%20get%20into,that%20consistently%20make%20a%20difference):

1. **Capability:** Do we have the right mix of knowledge, skills and team‚Äërelated competencies? Teams need both task skills and teamwork skills like giving/receiving feedback, communication and conflict resolution[leadershipnow.com](https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/2021/01/teams_that_work.html#:~:text=Fundamental%20question%3A%20Do%20we%20have,knowledge%2C%20skills%2C%20and%20other%20attributes).

2. **Communication:** Do team members share useful information clearly and on time? Quality is more important than quantity; communicating unique knowledge builds shared awareness[leadershipnow.com](https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/2021/01/teams_that_work.html#:~:text=Communication).

3. **Cognition:** Do we possess a shared mental model‚Äîcommon understanding of priorities, roles and strategies? Shared mental models improve coordination and performance[leadershipnow.com](https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/2021/01/teams_that_work.html#:~:text=Cognition).

4. **Conditions:** Is the context supportive? Adequate resources, positive culture and strong organisational policies encourage teamwork[leadershipnow.com](https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/2021/01/teams_that_work.html#:~:text=Fundamental%20question%3A%20Is%20the%20context,ample%20resources%2C%20supportive%20culture).

5. **Coordination:** Are team members demonstrating necessary behaviours (maintaining situational awareness, providing backup, learning and adapting, managing emotions)? Coordination is about behaviour, not attitude[leadershipnow.com](https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/2021/01/teams_that_work.html#:~:text=Coordination).

6. **Cooperation:** Do members trust each other and feel psychologically safe? Cooperation manifests as trust, psychological safety, collective efficacy and cohesion[leadershipnow.com](https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/2021/01/teams_that_work.html#:~:text=Cooperation).

7. **Coaching:** Does leadership (formal or shared) ensure clarity, accountability, emotional management and learning? Coaching functions include ensuring clarity, removing obstacles, fostering psychological safety, encouraging participation and promoting adaptation[leadershipnow.com](https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/2021/01/teams_that_work.html#:~:text=Coaching).

These drivers provide a framework for diagnosing team strengths and weaknesses.

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Recognising and Overcoming Team Dysfunctions**

Patrick Lencioni‚Äôs model of the **Five Dysfunctions of a Team** complements the seven drivers by highlighting common pitfalls that undermine collaboration. The dysfunctions form a pyramid: each layer builds on the one below it, so weaknesses at lower levels make it harder to address issues higher up[bitesizelearning.co.uk](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary-pyramid#:~:text=The%20five%20dysfunctions%20of%20a,team%2C%20explained).

### **1\) Absence of trust**

Trust is the foundation of teamwork. Teams lacking trust conceal weaknesses and mistakes, hesitate to ask for help and jump to conclusions about others‚Äô intentions[bitesizelearning.co.uk](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary-pyramid#:~:text=Let%E2%80%99s%20explore%20Lencioni%E2%80%99s%205%20team,dysfunctions%20in%20more%20detail). To diagnose trust issues, ask: *Do people feel comfortable admitting mistakes and fears? Is there guardedness or openness?*[bitesizelearning.co.uk](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary-pyramid#:~:text=,trust). Tactics to build trust include facilitating team‚Äëbuilding exercises, modelling vulnerability as a leader and promoting open communication[bitesizelearning.co.uk](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary-pyramid#:~:text=,trust%20among%20team%20members).

### **2\) Fear of conflict**

Without trust, team members fear conflict and avoid discussing controversial topics, depriving the team of diverse perspectives[bitesizelearning.co.uk](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary-pyramid#:~:text=2). Diagnose this by observing whether meetings are passive or dynamic and whether disagreements are seen as a tool for decision‚Äëmaking[bitesizelearning.co.uk](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary-pyramid#:~:text=,fear%20of%20conflict). Overcome this fear by establishing rules for healthy debate, rewarding candour and mediating disagreements so conflict remains focused on ideas[bitesizelearning.co.uk](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary-pyramid#:~:text=1,as%20it%27s%20respectful%20and%20constructive).

### **3\) Lack of commitment**

When people are afraid to voice dissent, they disengage from decisions and fail to commit to the team‚Äôs goals[bitesizelearning.co.uk](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary-pyramid#:~:text=3). Symptoms include ambiguity about goals and hesitation to follow through[bitesizelearning.co.uk](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary-pyramid#:~:text=,lack%20of%20commitment). Combat this by involving everyone in decision‚Äëmaking, clearly communicating the team‚Äôs vision and celebrating achievements[bitesizelearning.co.uk](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary-pyramid#:~:text=,lack%20of%20commitment).

### **4\) Avoidance of accountability**

If people are not committed, they avoid holding themselves and others accountable for performance[bitesizelearning.co.uk](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary-pyramid#:~:text=Team%20members%20who%20have%20not,feel%20accountable%20for%20achieving%20it). Warning signs include overlooking low standards and reluctance to ask for better[bitesizelearning.co.uk](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary-pyramid#:~:text=,avoidance%20of%20accountability). Tactics include setting clear expectations, applying standards consistently, making progress visible and leading by example[bitesizelearning.co.uk](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary-pyramid#:~:text=,avoidance%20of%20accountability).

### **5\) Inattention to results**

When accountability is absent, individuals focus on personal goals rather than collective success[bitesizelearning.co.uk](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary-pyramid#:~:text=5). Ask: *Are we more focused on personal recognition or team results? Would people make personal sacrifices for the team?*[bitesizelearning.co.uk](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary-pyramid#:~:text=,to%20results). To refocus on results, set team goals, reward team success and emphasise collective achievements over individual accomplishments[bitesizelearning.co.uk](https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary-pyramid#:~:text=1,regularly%20check%20in%20on%20progress).

Lencioni‚Äôs pyramid reminds us that trust and constructive conflict are prerequisites for commitment, accountability and results. Use these dysfunctions as a checklist when diagnosing team issues and designing interventions.

## **üîé Team Self‚ÄëAssessment**

Use the checklist below to evaluate your team against the seven drivers. Rate each area on a scale of 1‚Äì5 (1 \= needs significant improvement; 5 \= strong). Discuss results with your team to prioritise improvements.

| Driver | Reflection questions | Rating |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Capability | Do we have the right mix of skills? Are we comfortable giving and receiving feedback? |  |
| Communication | Do we share information clearly and on time? Do we communicate unique knowledge rather than duplicate information? |  |
| Cognition | Do we have a shared understanding of our goals, roles and strategies? |  |
| Conditions | Are resources, incentives and culture supportive of teamwork? |  |
| Coordination | Do we back each other up, adapt quickly and manage conflict constructively? |  |
| Cooperation | Do we trust one another and feel safe voicing ideas? Do we celebrate wins together? |  |
| Coaching | Do leaders and peers clarify expectations, remove obstacles and encourage participation? |  |

### **Individual Reflection**

Consider your own teamwork habits:

* How do you contribute to or detract from clear communication? Do you listen actively and share information in a timely manner?

* When conflicts arise, do you lean into constructive dialogue or avoid the conversation?

* Do you take time to understand colleagues‚Äô perspectives and values? How do you handle disagreements?

* How comfortable are you asking for or offering help? Do you assume you must solve everything alone?

Use your reflections to set personal improvement goals.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Practices & Habits for Stronger Teams**

Building high‚Äëperforming teams is an ongoing practice. Below are daily and weekly habits aligned with the seven drivers.

### **Daily Micro‚ÄëPractices**

* **Psychological safety check.** Before meetings, remind yourself to stay curious, avoid blame and encourage all voices. Start by acknowledging small mistakes or uncertainties yourself to model openness.

* **Active listening & summarising.** During discussions, summarise what you heard and ask clarifying questions. This ensures understanding and builds shared mental models.

* **Micro‚Äëgratitude.** Each day, thank a team member for something specific they did. Recognising contributions strengthens trust and cooperation.

* **Defensiveness radar.** Notice physical cues (tight shoulders, rapid heartbeat) when you feel defensive. Take a breath, relax, and choose curiosity over defensiveness. Reducing defensiveness improves collaboration and problem solving.

### **Weekly & Monthly Habits**

* **Stand‚Äëup retrospectives.** At the end of each week or sprint, hold a 15‚Äëminute retrospective to review what went well, what could be improved and adjustments needed. Focus on behaviours and processes, not blame.

* **Role clarity sessions.** Periodically revisit team roles and responsibilities to ensure everyone knows who owns what and how roles interconnect. Misaligned roles are a common source of friction and inefficiency.

* **Team learning hour.** Rotate responsibility for sharing a short learning (e.g., a book summary, a podcast insight or an article). Encourage cross‚Äëdisciplinary knowledge and continuous learning.

* **Inclusive norms refresh.** Regularly review team norms around inclusion (e.g., using inclusive language, equal talk time, addressing microaggressions) and adjust as needed.

### **Habit Loop: Cue ‚Üí Routine ‚Üí Reward ‚Üí Reflection**

* **Cue:** Use the start of each meeting as a cue to practice a teamwork behaviour (e.g., share a gratitude, encourage quieter voices, summarise shared understanding).

* **Routine:** Implement the behaviour consistently, such as rotating facilitators, using hand signals for consensus or employing structured turn‚Äëtaking.

* **Reward:** Notice the positive impact‚Äî smoother discussions, more engagement, quicker problem resolution‚Äîand celebrate it.

* **Reflection:** At the end of the meeting, ask: *What worked? Where did we struggle? How can we adjust our routine?*

## **üåà Diversity & Inclusion in Teams**

High‚Äëperforming teams embrace diversity of thought, background and personality. However, diversity alone does not ensure inclusion. Consider these practices:

* **Educate yourself about microaggressions.** Use resources like *The Micropedia of Microaggressions* to understand subtle biases and how to address them. Addressing microaggressions is key to psychological safety.

* **Support colleagues facing discrimination or violence.** Articles highlight the importance of supporting Asian peers amid rising anti‚ÄëAsian violence. This translates to standing up for colleagues facing prejudice and ensuring equitable treatment for all.

* **Recognise systemic barriers.** Women and minorities often feel pressure to adapt to dominant corporate cultures or experience moral injury/burnout. Acknowledge these challenges and adapt policies to create more inclusive environments.

* **Encourage equity.** Use inclusive hiring practices (avoiding bias such as anti‚ÄëJewish discrimination), equitable opportunities for advancement and transparent feedback.

## **üß≠ Final Reflection & Action Plan**

Reflect on the following questions and translate your insights into concrete actions:

1. **Which driver is currently weakest in your team?** What is one small experiment you can run to improve it?

2. **How do you personally contribute to psychological safety?** What defensive behaviours do you need to let go of?

3. **What practices will you implement daily and weekly** to cultivate better communication, shared understanding and cooperation?

4. **How will you leverage diverse perspectives** and ensure inclusive behaviour within your team?

Write a short action plan summarising your commitments. Share it with a colleague or mentor for accountability.

Teamwork is a living practice. By consciously addressing the drivers of effectiveness, nurturing psychological safety and embracing diverse voices, your team can thrive even in complex, high‚Äëpressure environments.
