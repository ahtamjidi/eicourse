## **1\. MATERIAL STRUCTURE & FORMAT**

### **A. Format Philosophy: Markdown/Minimalist Mode**

* Develop a **free-form, markdown-style version** of the course for users like AJ who prefer minimal formatting.  
* This version should strip away visual formatting to prioritize core ideas, activities, and personal notes.  
* Design it to be **portable across platforms** (Notion, Google Docs).

### **B. Individual \+ Team Relevance**

* All modules should have **both an "Individual Application" and a "Team-Based Advice" section**.  
* Create manager-specific footnotes or sidebars with team-focused recommendations, e.g., "For Managers: Try a Monday Check-in using Johari Grid prompts."

### **C. Mindfulness as Core Practice**

* Mindfulness-based practices are embedded as the **daily foundation** of the course.  
* Every module starts or ends with a 2–5 minute **mindfulness exercise** (with optional community breathwork).

### **D. Behavior Change Process Integration**

* Introduce Stanford GSB’s **habit-building framework**: Cue → Routine → Reward → Reflection.  
* Integrate this loop across all exercises and journaling prompts.  
* Teach learners how to form self-awareness routines, not just absorb information.

### **E. Science Snapshot Section**

* Each module includes a micro-section called **"Neuroscience in 60 Seconds"**.  
* Brief summaries (3–5 bullet points) connect emotional self-awareness to neuroscience (e.g., amygdala response, interoception, vagus nerve).  
* Supplement with links to Huberman Lab or similar.

## **2\. LEARNING PATH & PRESENTATION**

### **A. Quick First Pass Philosophy**

* Encourage learners to complete a **"first pass" in under 1 hour**, using:  
  * Curated links (e.g., How We Feel app, short breathing practice)  
  * Choice of 1–2 focus areas for deep dives later

### **B. Personalized Curriculum Spreadsheet**

* Provide a spreadsheet for learners to:  
  * Pick topics they want to engage with  
  * Track activity-based (practice) vs reading-based (insight) learning  
  * Monitor progress over time

### **C. Desirable Difficulty Integration**

* Apply Robert Bjork’s theory of "desirable difficulty": slow, effortful learning is more durable.  
* Mark modules with challenge levels: Easy, Moderate, Stretch.  
* Emphasize layering and reflection over time rather than fast completion.

### **D. Community & Cohort Support**

* Offer **weekly cohort sessions** for breathwork and peer check-ins.  
* Create light-touch sprints (e.g., 5-day focus on self-regulation or emotional labeling).

### **E. Completeness vs Usefulness Mindset**

* Reframe course as a **year-long integration**, not a one-time course.  
* Provide checkpoint reviews (monthly/seasonal) for journaling, review, or re-choosing focus areas.

## **3\. ADDITIONAL TOOLS & REFERENCE CONTENT**

### **A. Spreadsheet of Tools & Resources**

* Maintain a shared document listing:  
  * Tool name, category (Individual/Team), duration, challenge level, reference source  
  * Assessment access (e.g., MAAS PDF, EQ 2.0 license, MBTI tools)

### **B. Reading & Summary Library**

* Offer a curated bank of summaries from key books (e.g., *Attention Management*, *Insight*, *Search Inside Yourself*).  
* Include AJ-style minimal summaries: 1-2 insights, 1 quote, 1 action step per book.

## **4\. DESIGN PRINCIPLES TO RETAIN**

* **Minimalism**: Format-light, clean, focused on content  
* **Science-backed**: Grounded in psychology and neuroscience  
* **Habit-centric**: Emphasis on daily shifts, not academic theory alone  
* **Team-friendly**: Manager check-ins, team sprints, group activities  
* **Reflective-first**: Prompts, journaling, and emotional noticing as core to every lesson

#### **1\. Compelling Introduction with Context & Relevance**

* Starts with a striking **hook or statistic** to establish urgency or curiosity.

* Defines the core concept (e.g., self-awareness) in accessible terms.

* Clarifies **why it matters** at both the individual and team/managerial level.

---

#### **2\. Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes**

* **Objectives** outline the transformational purpose of the course (why it exists).

* **Outcomes** list clear, actionable things learners will be able to do by the end.

---

#### **3\. Foundational Theory \+ Science**

* Includes a brief but credible **neuroscience or research foundation** to legitimize the topic.

* Integrates key thinkers (e.g., Daniel Goleman, Tasha Eurich).

---

#### **4\. Statistical Insight & Practical Framing**

* Provides relevant **statistics** to anchor the learner in the real-world significance of the topic.

* Links theory to performance, leadership, or emotional well-being.

---

#### **5\. Structured Self-Assessment Tools**

* Recommends a **core assessment approach** (one for individuals, one for teams).

* Provides a curated list of additional tools for deeper or ongoing exploration.

---

#### **6\. Insight Mapping & Tracker Activity**

* Introduces a **guided self-tracker** (e.g., 7 Pillars of Insight) for learners to reflect and record progress.

* Reinforces learning through writing or journaling.

#### **7\. Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Team-Based Habits**

* Encourages learners to embed knowledge through **repeatable micro-practices**.

* Balances **individual rituals** with **scalable team practices**.

---

#### **8\. Real-World Application**

* Focuses on how to apply the learning in **challenging moments**, such as feedback, stress, or leadership scenarios.

* Distinguishes between **individual use** and **manager/team use**.

---

#### **9\. Final Reflection & Cultural Scaling**

* Encourages structured reflection to consolidate learning.

* Offers ways to **scale insight into team rituals and organizational culture**.

---

#### **10\. Curated Resource Library**

* Includes **books, podcasts, videos, and articles** with links and short rationales.

* Supports **ongoing self-directed development**.

---

#### **11\. Timeline \+ Task List Format**

* Course is broken into **5 core sessions or modules** (\~5–6 hours total).

* Paired with a **checklist or task summary** (with one-liner task descriptions).

New thoughts

I need to emphasize two things as the underlying threat connecting all of these topics in terms of a mindset that people need to adapt and the two words that comes to my mind are resilience and resonance for resilience we have good resources and for resonance that is related to the team and that is how a leader can create resonance and Richard boycott's course is very helpful in teaching people how to use resonance and the primary leadership book was a very good source of understanding what resonance resonant leadership is.

 I'm also thinking of starting the course with showing a street fight or a group of people who are dancing together and explain the concepts that results in such a Harmony and beautiful thing it means that people in order to achieve such a beautiful performance or such a very agile reaction to very difficult situation they they need to study and learn patterns and improve their muscle memory and their muscles are on doing both individual acts like Conflict Management like self-regulation and also the street fight emphasizes the part about being able to pick and choose what to do in reaction to a certain reality and this emphasizes that usually the real case scenarios in real life require coordination of more than one skill within the EI framework so we need to emphasize more of this in the course and probably come up with some activities and some of the assessments that help people to or cases studies that help people to get more in tune with this aspect so street fight versus just doing exercises you usually like work on your biceps you usually work on your punches but the street fight you need to coordinate and you need to pick and choose very quickly what is required and this is the this is what takes time and requires perseverance now going back to the the dance example we can come up with some of the like ballet dancers or Chinese dancers this requires such a performance is successful if both individuals are very good and the coordination between them and the leadership inspiring them to do great things is there and I call that resonance which means that the leader and each individual creates a resonance with others so that they move in a way that creates Beauty and creates a great performance so these are the things that I want to emphasize as well

 the third part that I'm thinking a lot lately is why or how knowing about Neuroscience can help us this is usually helpful for people to to create a mental model or thinking model of how things work so they can calibrate their behavior or they can reason about the effect of their chosen strategy in handling certain things into a very high stakes conversation if they know what is happening in their brain and how every word choice of word that they make can affect the brain of the other person they can make better decisions and prepare themselves because they don't they know that what part of the brain is activated how we can control that and for example if they're under too much stress they know that mindfulness can help them or if they know that the person who who they are talking to is very like conflict prone so they know what words they can use what is happening in their mind so they can quickly react to that that reality and for a leader knowing about Neuroscience would help them in situations that is very very it is very difficult to gather information for ourselves self-awareness is a bit easier because we we have almost instant access to ourselves and our emotions if we train ourselves to do that but reading the room and understanding how are actions affect others is very difficult because we don't have instant access to people's mind and knowing about the the Neuroscience of this can help leaders to to tune into the what is happening around them to the team on Tuesday actions based on that

 the other aspect that I've been thinking about is about the development of the Course once we are a little bit happy with one of the units and we are converged on the way we want people to take these courses we can open it up in a slack Channel ask for people to come and do some activities so that we gather information on the usefulness of the course and how we people interact with the course so one of the things that we need to start thinking about is we can pick one or two modules and think about how we can advertise it and bring people in so that they brainstorming about it they go and study they provide feedback and then we use that feedback into improving that unit and also the presentation of the course so this eventually is is part of like advertising the course so probably most people in the company would have been exposed to most of the material by the time we finish you know the course and that way we have engaged more people and because they they have an input and they provide input so they take ownership of the material and I think this is a very helpful in making sure that people absorb the content instead of just saying these are great content rose on AJ created so you should use it but if we engage them in just taking part into creating the course then they they would be more active in using the rest of the material

Conflict Material

* Look through the material,   
* We wants be realistic, examples based course, we need to have a coherent Uh um you know what I'm asking and affirm that eaterative process some good things will come out uh so let's chat you can even leave voice messages you know I'm just looking or text messages is fine but voices like I can listen quickly yeah uh yeah yeah um so I think this is just from you sometimes even you hear you know that these things so actually like Confrontation uh conflict management mediation these when when conversations maybe sticks are high that's very it's like driving in in you know fastest speed in very you know high traffic that's why it's not very easy to requires people seeing it okay this is how this person hungry and uh I think that's why I included some podcasts so especially a you know uh like you listen to just say oh this was really good like you know there was a time I couldn't say something to AJ and I or ages it's something or you know those type of things that you find it very useful I think that stuff uh that's what I'm actually uh looking for yes yes I I understand you with let me just say with the ones that have created doing things that have come to realize is that you can't really between really provide all the resources that you think will make sure that person that person's conflict management skill good gets to 100% the best way is providing the most quality one and also providing the rest where they could do so look through it up there at their own time so yeah I understand yeah so that's why You know that it could be like mighty also challenging meaning that it's not very true and I would say that event for cell far awareness where we started we do have those activities yes for conflict management we are yet to find those um best activities but for instance for self awareness uh there are various uh tools that we have provided so that someone could actually take time and and make use of them to actually know their levels and also improve so so awareness Focus those are uh causes that I would say yes yes I I can't think of like the what other thing I have it provided because I've given you activities assessments of giving you even more resources uh on on improving so yeah 

For each unit, have a subfolder for each, and attach the resources, notion(
