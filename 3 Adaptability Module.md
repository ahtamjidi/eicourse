# **Adaptability Module**

**Format and Philosophy**

This module continues the minimalist, markdown‑style approach used in the previous courses. It includes **individual** and **team‑based** sections, short mindfulness practices at the beginning or end of each session, and habit‑building loops (Cue → Routine → Reward → Reflection). A **“Neuroscience in 60 Seconds”** snapshot appears in every session to connect practice to science. Sessions are marked with **challenge levels** (Easy/Moderate/Stretch) to encourage desirable difficulty. Learners can use a spreadsheet to track which activities they complete, monitor progress and reflect on insights.

## **Session 1 – Understanding Adaptability *(Easy)***

**Hook & Relevance**

In today’s workplace, change is the only constant. A Coursera course on *Adaptability and Resiliency* notes that adaptability is your ability to change your actions, course or approach to suit different conditions or environments, intentionally navigating—rather than being driven by—changing circumstances[coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/learn/adaptability-and-resiliency#:~:text=Adaptability%20refers%20to%20your%20ability,chaos%20while%20inflexible%20people%20flounder). Resilience, by contrast, is the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties, bouncing forward with new learning[coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/learn/adaptability-and-resiliency#:~:text=Adaptability%20refers%20to%20your%20ability,Both%20adaptability%20and). Understanding this distinction sets the stage for developing both capacities.

**Definition**

Adaptability is an emotional and social intelligence leadership competency that involves the **flexibility to handle change**, balance multiple demands and generate fresh ideas in new situations. Unlike resilience, which emphasises bouncing back after adversity, adaptability implies an active choice to pivot and embrace change[innerdrive.co.uk](https://www.innerdrive.co.uk/blog/resilience-and-adaptability/#:~:text=So%2C%20what%E2%80%99s%20the%20difference%3F). It requires noticing when conditions shift, finding alternative approaches and adjusting behaviour[innerdrive.co.uk](https://www.innerdrive.co.uk/blog/resilience-and-adaptability/#:~:text=What%20is%20adaptability%3F). Adaptable leaders remain comfortable with uncertainty, adjusting strategies and styles as needed.

### **Course Objectives & Outcomes**

By completing this module you will be able to:

* Distinguish adaptability from resilience and explain why both are important.

* Identify your natural response patterns to change and use mindfulness to increase flexibility.

* Develop cognitive, emotional and behavioural adaptability skills such as curiosity, continuous learning, emotional regulation and creative problem solving[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/types-of-adaptability-skills#:~:text=Cognitive%20adaptability%20involves%20processing%20new,mindedness)[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-increase-adaptability#:~:text=1).

* Employ habit loops to cultivate adaptability at work and in life.

* Build team norms that foster adaptability, including self‑evaluation, affirmative environment and proactive problem solving.

### **Science Snapshot – Neuroscience in 60 Seconds**

* **Neuroplasticity**: Repeatedly stepping outside your comfort zone forms new neural pathways, making flexible thinking easier. Adaptability is therefore a skill that can be learned and strengthened over time.

* **Cognitive Flexibility**: Research suggests that cognitive flexibility—the ability to switch between different rules or tasks—is supported by the prefrontal cortex and is linked to better learning and mental health.

* **Stress and Adaptability**: Studies indicate that adaptability serves as a protective factor against stress and burnout[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-increase-adaptability#:~:text=Becoming%20more%20adaptable%20can%20also,be%20helpful%20in%20%2055). Learning to adjust responses reduces physiological stress responses.

### **Individual Application**

1. **Mindfulness Check‑In (2 min)** – Sit quietly and notice your breathing. Ask yourself: How do I typically respond when plans change suddenly? Identify emotions (e.g., frustration, curiosity). *(Cue: start of session; Routine: mindful reflection; Reward: increased self‑awareness; Reflection: jot down insights.)*

2. **Difference Reflection** – Reflect on a recent challenge. Did you bounce back to previous routines (resilience) or adopt a new approach (adaptability)? Write about the benefits and drawbacks of each.

3. **Mindset Journal** – Note areas where you’re rigid (e.g., insisting on your way) vs. areas where you’re flexible. Identify one behaviour you would like to change, such as welcoming last‑minute feedback instead of resisting it.

### **Team‑Based Advice**

* **Team Discussion** – During a team meeting, discuss the difference between adaptability and resilience. Use the InnerDrive definitions: resilience is coping and bouncing back after setbacks, whereas adaptability is intentionally adjusting behaviours to new conditions[innerdrive.co.uk](https://www.innerdrive.co.uk/blog/resilience-and-adaptability/#:~:text=What%20is%20Resilience%3F).

* **Change Map** – Create a map of recent changes (new workflows, technology, market shifts). For each, discuss how the team reacted. Did you adapt or only endure? What lessons can be learned?

## **Session 2 – Components of Adaptability *(Moderate)***

### **Key Concepts**

* **Cognitive, Personality and Emotional Adaptability** – BetterUp explains that adaptability skills can be cognitive (processing new information), personality‑based (adjusting behaviour to context) and emotional (acknowledging and moving past change)[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/types-of-adaptability-skills#:~:text=Cognitive%20adaptability%20involves%20processing%20new,mindedness). Cognitive adaptability draws on curiosity and continuous learning[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/types-of-adaptability-skills#:~:text=Cognitive%20adaptability%20involves%20processing%20new,mindedness); personality‑based adaptability relies on resourcefulness, communication and teamwork[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/types-of-adaptability-skills#:~:text=Personality,is%20helpful%20in%20the%20workplace); emotional adaptability involves resilience and psychological flexibility[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-increase-adaptability#:~:text=Emotional%20adaptability%20skills%20focus%20on,skill%20that%20shows%20inner%20strength).

* **Skill Examples** – Specific adaptability skills include curiosity, continuous learning, resourcefulness, communication, organisational skills, teamwork and resilience[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/types-of-adaptability-skills#:~:text=Cognitive%20adaptability%20involves%20processing%20new,mindedness). Signs of an adaptable person include being present, practising positive self‑talk, seeing the bigger picture, enjoying experimentation and exhibiting empathy[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/types-of-adaptability-skills#:~:text=1,embrace%20change%20as%20it%20happens).

* **Growth Mindset** – Adaptable people believe skills can be developed (growth mindset), which encourages them to try new strategies rather than clinging to past methods.

### **Science Snapshot – Neuroscience in 60 Seconds**

* **Curiosity & Reward** – Curiosity activates the brain’s reward circuitry, releasing dopamine and making learning more pleasurable. Embracing curiosity helps you adapt by seeking novel information and solutions.

* **Anchoring Bias** – The tendency to rely on initial information (anchoring) can hinder adaptability. Recognising anchoring bias and intentionally seeking disconfirming evidence improves cognitive flexibility[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-increase-adaptability#:~:text=2).

### **Individual Application**

1. **Skill Inventory** – Using the BetterUp list, rate yourself on curiosity, learning, resourcefulness, communication, organisation, teamwork and resilience on a scale of 1–5. Identify two strengths and two growth areas[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/types-of-adaptability-skills#:~:text=Cognitive%20adaptability%20involves%20processing%20new,mindedness).

2. **Curiosity Exercise** – Pick a problem at work or home. Generate five questions about it that you haven’t asked before. Research or brainstorm possible answers. Notice how curiosity broadens your thinking.

3. **Anchoring Awareness** – Reflect on a time you dismissed new information because it contradicted your beliefs. Consider how anchoring bias played a role[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-increase-adaptability#:~:text=2). Set a cue to pause and ask, “What if the opposite were true?” when confronted with new data.

### **Team‑Based Advice**

* **Skill Swap** – Organize a knowledge‑sharing session where team members teach each other a new tool or concept (e.g., a coding trick, marketing strategy). This promotes continuous learning and cognitive adaptability.

* **Growth Mindset Stories** – Have team members share a story where trying a new approach led to improvement. Celebrate experimentation and reinforce the idea that mistakes are opportunities to learn.

## **Session 3 – Developing Self‑Awareness & Emotional Regulation *(Moderate)***

### **Key Concepts**

* **Precursor Competencies** – Adaptability is built on **emotional self‑awareness** and **emotional self‑control**[keystepmedia.com](https://www.keystepmedia.com/how-to-coach-adaptability-leadership/#:~:text=Because%20leaders%20like%20Janet%20begin,some%20combination%20of%20these%20questions). Without recognising your own feelings and managing impulses, it’s hard to respond flexibly to change.

* **Letting Go of the Past** – Key Step Media’s coaching case study shows that new leaders often cling to behaviours that made them successful as individual contributors. To adapt, they must acknowledge the endings and losses inherent in transitions and consciously shift values and behaviors[keystepmedia.com](https://www.keystepmedia.com/how-to-coach-adaptability-leadership/#:~:text=Adapting%20Starts%20with%20Self).

* **Micro‑Moment Choices** – Adaptation happens in countless small moments. Leaders can choose to intervene directly (doer) or empower others. Being aware of this choice and having strategies (deep breaths, inner coach reminders, accountability partners) helps shift habits[keystepmedia.com](https://www.keystepmedia.com/how-to-coach-adaptability-leadership/#:~:text=Deeply%20exploring%20this%20moment%20of,or%20delegates%20to%20other%20staff).

* **Rigidity vs Adaptability** – The Adaptability Primer notes that adaptable leaders are less emotionally triggered by unexpected events; they quickly shift to searching for solutions and refine strategies when surprises arise. In contrast, rigid leaders feel threatened by change and resist new ideas.

### **Science Snapshot – Neuroscience in 60 Seconds**

* **Emotion Regulation** – The prefrontal cortex helps regulate emotional responses from the amygdala. Practising mindfulness and self‑soothing techniques (like deep breathing) strengthens this regulation, making it easier to stay calm and think flexibly.

* **Intentional Change Theory** – Richard Boyatzis’s Intentional Change Model suggests that visualising your ideal self opens your mind to new possibilities. This aspirational thinking activates neural pathways associated with motivation and goal pursuit.

### **Individual Application**

1. **Endings Reflection** – Identify a role or habit you’ve recently outgrown. Write about what you gained from it and what you need to let go of[keystepmedia.com](https://www.keystepmedia.com/how-to-coach-adaptability-leadership/#:~:text=Adapting%20Starts%20with%20Self). Acknowledge any feelings of loss.

2. **Micro‑Moment Planning** – Think of a situation where you tend to revert to old habits (e.g., jumping in to fix a colleague’s problem). Create a plan: a mantra to remind you to delegate, a breathing exercise, and an accountability partner[keystepmedia.com](https://www.keystepmedia.com/how-to-coach-adaptability-leadership/#:~:text=Deeply%20exploring%20this%20moment%20of,or%20delegates%20to%20other%20staff). Keep this plan accessible and review after each occurrence.

3. **Self‑Compassion Break** – When change triggers frustration, pause to notice the emotion, accept that it’s normal and offer yourself kindness. This reduces emotional reactivity and fosters adaptability.

### **Team‑Based Advice**

* **Team Endings Conversation** – Facilitate a discussion about what the team needs to let go of to move forward (e.g., outdated processes, roles). Normalise feelings of loss and focus on the benefits of change.

* **Micro‑Moment Drills** – Role play common micro‑moments (e.g., unexpected scope changes). Practice responding in adaptable ways—seeking input, brainstorming options—rather than reacting impulsively.

## **Session 4 – Building Adaptable Teams *(Stretch)***

### **Key Concepts**

* **Team Self‑Evaluation** – Research cited in the Adaptability Primer shows that high‑performing teams regularly assess, update and align their goals and action plans. They adopt a norm called *Team Self‑Evaluation*, holding periodic meetings to discuss strengths and weaknesses and inviting feedback through surveys or digital tools.

* **Affirmative Environment & Proactive Problem‑Solving** – Two additional norms support team adaptability: creating an environment that focuses on strengths and possibilities (affirmative environment) and proactively identifying and solving problems before they become crises. Inclusion in these processes increases members’ sense of belonging and control.

* **Team Emotional Intelligence Norms** – Teams with open communication, empathy, trust and conflict resolution skills adapt more effectively. Studies show that emotional regulation, constructive conflict resolution and shared vision contribute to adaptability[innerdrive.co.uk](https://www.innerdrive.co.uk/blog/resilience-and-adaptability/#:~:text=Emotion%20vs%20Behaviour).

* **Adaptability vs Resilience at Team Level** – Adaptable teams adjust strategies and workflows when new information emerges, whereas resilient teams recover together from setbacks. Both are important, but adaptability enables proactive change rather than reactive recovery.

### **Science Snapshot – Neuroscience in 60 Seconds**

* **Belonging & Social Safety** – Neuroscience research highlights that social exclusion activates brain regions linked to physical pain. By fostering belonging through inclusive decision‑making and affirmative environments, teams reduce threat responses and increase cognitive capacity for adaptation.

* **Collective Intelligence** – Teams with higher social sensitivity and equal contribution tend to have higher collective intelligence. Emotional intelligence norms support this sensitivity and thus improve team adaptability.

### **Individual Application**

1. **Team Check‑In Ritual** – Suggest a regular (e.g., weekly) check‑in where team members share one challenge and one opportunity. Focus on listening and brainstorming, not immediate problem solving. This builds the habit of proactive problem solving and creates an affirmative environment.

2. **Team Self‑Evaluation Survey** – Work with your team to design a brief survey that asks about goal alignment, process efficiency, communication and adaptability. Review results together and agree on one improvement for the next cycle.

3. **Positive Feedback Loop** – At the end of each project milestone, encourage team members to name one thing that went well and one thing they learned. This reinforces a growth mindset and normalises reflection.

### **Team‑Based Advice**

* **Norm Agreement** – As a team, define norms for adaptability: regular self‑evaluation, openness to feedback, assumption of positive intent and shared responsibility for problem solving. Document these norms and revisit them quarterly.

* **Manager Footnote** – Leaders should model adaptability by being transparent about changes, soliciting input and sharing decision rationales. Recognising and rewarding adaptable behaviours reinforces the norm.

## **Session 5 – Integrating Adaptability into Daily Practice *(Easy to Moderate)***

### **Key Concepts**

* **Habit Loops & Continuous Learning** – Adaptability is cultivated through daily habits of curiosity, experimentation and reflection. Practising small adaptive behaviours (e.g., trying a new route to work, learning a new shortcut) reinforces neural pathways for flexibility.

* **Positive Mindset & Self‑Talk** – Adaptable individuals maintain a positive outlook, use affirming self‑talk and see challenges as opportunities[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/types-of-adaptability-skills#:~:text=1,embrace%20change%20as%20it%20happens). They focus on the bigger picture and enjoy experimenting[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/types-of-adaptability-skills#:~:text=3,don%E2%80%99t%20feel%20discouraged%20or%20distracted).

* **Mental Health & Support Systems** – Adaptability is linked to mental health and life satisfaction; people adapt better when they have a solid social support system[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/types-of-adaptability-skills#:~:text=The%20importance%20of%20adaptability%20for,mental%20health). Seeking support and maintaining strong relationships reduces stress and anxiety during change.

* **Leveraging Purpose** – Adaptability is easier when work is connected to personal purpose. Reflecting on why change matters helps sustain motivation.

### **Science Snapshot – Neuroscience in 60 Seconds**

* **Dopamine & Learning** – Novelty triggers dopamine release, which facilitates learning and memory. Regularly engaging in new experiences enhances adaptability.

* **Social Support & Stress** – Social support mitigates the cortisol response to stress. Teams with strong support networks are better able to adapt to challenges[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/types-of-adaptability-skills#:~:text=The%20importance%20of%20adaptability%20for,mental%20health).

### **Individual Application**

1. **Daily Novelty Practice** – Incorporate one small novelty each day (e.g., eat a new food, read about a different industry). Notice how your mind responds.

2. **Positive Self‑Talk Script** – Identify a change that feels challenging. Write a positive affirmation (e.g., “This is an opportunity to learn”). Repeat it when facing unexpected events[betterup.com](https://www.betterup.com/blog/types-of-adaptability-skills#:~:text=1,embrace%20change%20as%20it%20happens).

3. **Support Network Map** – Draw a map of people you can rely on for support. Reach out to one person each week to strengthen the connection.

### **Team‑Based Advice**

* **Learning Sprint** – Organize periodic (e.g., quarterly) sprints focused on acquiring a new collective skill (e.g., exploring a new tool). Celebrate progress and share learnings.

* **Mental Health Resources** – Encourage team members to access mental health or coaching resources. Make space for discussions about stress and adaptability.
