# Comprehensive Review of the Team Emotional Intelligence (TEI) Model

## Introduction

Building a high‐performing team is **not simply about assembling star individuals**; more crucial is *how* team members work together[\[1\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=Many%20leaders%20believe%20that%20building,into%20focusing%20on%20individual%20performance). Decades of research in organizational psychology show that even highly talented groups can underperform if their interactions breed distrust or disengagement[\[2\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=By%20far%2C%20the%20best%20predictor,culture%2C%20making%20each%20team%20unique). This is where **Team Emotional Intelligence (TEI)** comes in. *Team EI* is defined as a group’s ability to develop **shared behavioral norms** that create a productive emotional and social environment – one that **fosters trust, collaboration, and high performance[\[3\]](https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/2025/07/unh-professors-book-shows-how-build-high-performing-teams#:~:text=Druskat%20defines%20Team%20EI%20as,trust%2C%20collaboration%2C%20and%20high%20performance)**. Pioneered by Vanessa Urch Druskat, Ph.D., the TEI model provides a framework for teams to cultivate these norms systematically. Managers and leaders who apply this model gain pragmatic tools to build teams that are not only effective but also emotionally resilient and inclusive. In this review, we examine all facets of Druskat’s TEI model, link each aspect to proven best practices, and cite scientific evidence supporting its impact on team success.

## Why Team Emotional Intelligence Matters

Research consistently finds that **team culture and norms** are better predictors of success than the sum of individual talents[\[1\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=Many%20leaders%20believe%20that%20building,into%20focusing%20on%20individual%20performance). For example, in Druskat’s first major study, she tracked 300 manufacturing teams performing identical tasks and discovered that the highest-performing teams *out-earned average teams by $9.8 million per year* – a difference attributed not to superior technical skills, but to a **distinct team culture**[\[4\]](https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/2025/07/unh-professors-book-shows-how-build-high-performing-teams#:~:text=The%20Team%20EI%20model%20took,and%20acknowledged%20one%20another%27s%20contributions). These top teams **“listened more, behaved in ways that inspired trust, and acknowledged one another's contributions,”** setting them apart from the rest[\[5\]](https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/2025/07/unh-professors-book-shows-how-build-high-performing-teams#:~:text=The%20Team%20EI%20model%20took,and%20acknowledged%20one%20another%27s%20contributions). In other words, their unwritten rules of interaction – or **team norms** – created a climate of trust and accountability that directly translated into better results. As Druskat explains, *“the norms a team adopted to coordinate and regularize how the team operated significantly differentiated high-performing and average-performing teams”*[\[6\]](https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/2025/07/unh-professors-book-shows-how-build-high-performing-teams#:~:text=,performing%20teams.%E2%80%9D).

Critically, emotionally intelligent team norms satisfy fundamental human needs that drive motivation. Neuroscience and social psychology tell us that people have a deep **need for belonging and acceptance**, and they react strongly to signals of exclusion or disrespect[\[7\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%20neuroscience,their%20own%20fate%E2%80%94and%20the%20team%E2%80%99s). Teams thrive when members feel valued and safe: *“Teamwork thrives when norms foster and maintain a sense of belonging within a community.”* In the highest-performing teams studied, reliable EI norms **engendered trust, psychological safety, and a shared sense of ownership** over outcomes[\[8\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%20neuroscience,their%20own%20fate%E2%80%94and%20the%20team%E2%80%99s). Members in such teams felt accepted and in control, which energized their collaboration. By contrast, teams lacking these norms often slide into negative cycles. Druskat gives the example of a talented executive team that struggled because they **lacked shared norms for accountability, respect, and emotional safety** – despite each individual’s intelligence and skill[\[9\]](https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/2025/07/unh-professors-book-shows-how-build-high-performing-teams#:~:text=Despite%20their%20intelligence%20and%20experience%2C,and%20emotional%20safety%2C%20Druskat%20says). Without trust or respectful communication, tensions flared (e.g. eye-rolls at a late colleague) and performance suffered, illustrating that **emotional climate can make or break a team**[\[10\]](https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/2025/07/unh-professors-book-shows-how-build-high-performing-teams#:~:text=In%20another%20study%2C%20Druskat%20worked,others%20as%20tensions%20quickly%20rose).

Modern findings reinforce the critical role of these “soft” factors. Google’s famous *Project Aristotle* study, which examined hundreds of teams, found that **psychological safety was the single most important dynamic** distinguishing top teams – more important than the individual talent on the team[\[11\]](https://business.google.com/us/think/future-of-marketing/five-dynamics-effective-team/#:~:text=1,members%20reliably%20complete%20quality%20work)[\[12\]](https://business.google.com/us/think/future-of-marketing/five-dynamics-effective-team/#:~:text=Perhaps%20most%20remarkably%2C%20the%20number,in%20some%20of%20the%20weakest). Other key factors included dependability and clear structure & goals[\[13\]](https://business.google.com/us/think/future-of-marketing/five-dynamics-effective-team/#:~:text=admitting%20mistakes%2C%20asking%20questions%2C%20or,and%20communicate%20specific%2C%20challenging%2C%20and), which align with the TEI model’s emphasis on accountability and role clarity. In short, **teams perform best when members feel safe to speak up, trust one another to do their part, and share a clear purpose**. TEI provides a roadmap for leaders to cultivate this kind of high-trust, high-engagement environment deliberately.

Not only does TEI improve team climate, it has measurable business benefits. The norms associated with team emotional intelligence lead to what Druskat calls a *“productive social and emotional environment,”* characterized by high psychological safety and efficacy, which in turn drives stronger team effectiveness[\[14\]](https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/276291#:~:text=between%20six%20emotionally%20intelligent%20team,Keywords%3A%20teams%2C%20effectiveness%2C%20emotional%20intelligence). In empirical studies, teams that **establish emotionally intelligent norms show significantly higher performance outcomes**, as these norms channel team members’ emotions positively (for instance, turning anxiety into constructive action)[\[15\]](https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/276291#:~:text=team%20member%20needs,Keywords%3A%20teams%2C%20effectiveness%2C%20emotional%20intelligence)[\[16\]](https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/276291#:~:text=We%20propose%20that%20team%20emotion,These). By addressing members’ social-emotional needs – like feeling understood, having influence, and finding meaning – EI norms prevent the “downward spirals” of mistrust and instead fuel **positive feedback loops of collaboration and learning**[\[17\]](https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/276291#:~:text=effectiveness%20,emotion%20is%20not%20as%20important)[\[16\]](https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/276291#:~:text=We%20propose%20that%20team%20emotion,These). For managers and leaders, this means that investing effort in team emotional intelligence is not a touchy-feely exercise, but a **scientifically grounded strategy for boosting team innovation, adaptability, and performance**[\[18\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=If%20there%20is%20a%20secret,into%20a%20team%E2%80%99s%20everyday%20culture).

## The Team Emotional Intelligence Model: Core Components

Druskat’s **Team EI Model** organizes the essential team norms into *three core clusters*[\[19\]](https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/2025/07/unh-professors-book-shows-how-build-high-performing-teams#:~:text=Druskat%20has%20spent%20her%20career,norms%20into%20three%20core%20clusters). Before these higher-level norms can take hold, however, **basic team fundamentals** must be in place. Druskat found that even to reach average performance, teams need a solid foundation of **clear purpose, defined goals, effective meeting processes, and clear roles/responsibilities**[\[20\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,And%20what%20we). These basics ensure the team has structure and clarity – echoing what Google also identified as crucial for team effectiveness[\[21\]](https://business.google.com/us/think/future-of-marketing/five-dynamics-effective-team/#:~:text=team%20effectiveness,personal%2C%20so%20it%20varies%20from). Once the fundamentals are set, the TEI model’s **emotionally intelligent norms** can elevate the team from merely adequate to *exceptional*. Below we detail each of the three core clusters of TEI norms and the best practices associated with them:

### 1\. **“Help One Another Succeed” – How Team Members Treat Each Other**

This first cluster focuses on the **norms of interaction among team members** – essentially, building a culture of mutual support, trust, and accountability. Key norms in this category include:

* **Understanding and Knowing Your Teammates:** High-EI teams make a deliberate effort to **get to know one another as people**, not just as job titles. Members are aware of each other’s strengths, skills, work styles, and even personal interests. Druskat emphasizes that people *“can’t trust you unless they know you”*, underscoring that taking time to understand colleagues is *“fundamental to building \[psychological\] safety and trust.”*[\[22\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,that%20way%20than%20just%20giving). Best practice: Leaders can facilitate this by arranging team-building activities, informal check-ins, or exercises where members share personal backgrounds and working preferences. Research on group emotional intelligence notes that norms of *interpersonal understanding* improve cooperation and morale[\[23\]](https://athena.ecs.csus.edu/~buckley/CSc192%20Web%20Files/HBR_Building_Emotional_Intelligence_of_Teams.pdf#:~:text=discomfort%2C%20and%20rather%20than%20being,taking%20pains%20to%20consider%20matters). For example, one study described a team that instituted a norm of *perspective-taking*: before making decisions, they ensured every member’s viewpoint was heard, which built trust and increased participation[\[24\]](https://athena.ecs.csus.edu/~buckley/CSc192%20Web%20Files/HBR_Building_Emotional_Intelligence_of_Teams.pdf#:~:text=perspective,yet%20or%20thought%20through%20completely%3F%E2%80%9D)[\[25\]](https://athena.ecs.csus.edu/~buckley/CSc192%20Web%20Files/HBR_Building_Emotional_Intelligence_of_Teams.pdf#:~:text=perspective%20taking%20is%20to%20ensure,to%20greater%20participation%20among%20members). **Tip for managers:** Encourage your team to regularly spend a few minutes in meetings to highlight individual updates or accomplishments, and consider cross-training or role shadowing so members appreciate each other’s contributions.

* **Demonstrating Caring and Respect:** In an emotionally intelligent team, *respect* is a core norm – members listen actively, show empathy, and value each other’s input. Team members feel that their colleagues **truly care about their well-being and success**, which bolsters each individual’s sense of self-worth and belonging. Simple behaviors like polite acknowledgement, constructive encouragement, and celebrating each other’s achievements can reinforce this norm. In Druskat’s model, respect and considerate listening “build belonging” in the team[\[26\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=team,another%2C%20and%20that%20builds%20belonging). **Pragmatic practices:** Leaders can model respectful communication (e.g. no interrupting, no dismissive remarks) and establish ground rules such as *“assume positive intent”* or *“one voice at a time”* in discussions. According to Druskat, belongingness is the *“glue”* that holds an effective team together[\[27\]](https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/2025/07/unh-professors-book-shows-how-build-high-performing-teams#:~:text=Druskat%20says%20belonging%20%E2%80%94%20the,inclusion%20was%20essential%20to%20survival) – when people feel accepted and valued, they are more motivated to collaborate and go the extra mile for the team.

* **Addressing Unhelpful or Unacceptable Behavior Constructively:** All teams face moments when a member’s behavior may hinder the group (for instance, missing deadlines, dominating discussions, or not following through on commitments). What sets an emotionally intelligent team apart is *how* they respond. Rather than avoiding the issue or ostracizing the offender, high-EI teams have norms that encourage **timely, direct, and constructive feedback** to call out unhelpful behavior[\[28\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20fundamental%20to%20building%20safety,just%20created%20negativity%20in%20the)[\[26\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=team,another%2C%20and%20that%20builds%20belonging). Druskat observed that in the best self-managing teams, members felt comfortable *“calling a foul”* when someone crossed a line, but did so in a way that remained respectful and solution-focused[\[29\]](https://athena.ecs.csus.edu/~buckley/CSc192%20Web%20Files/HBR_Building_Emotional_Intelligence_of_Teams.pdf#:~:text=Inevitably%2C%20a%20team%20member%20will,day%20she%20selfishly%20decided%20to). This prevents resentment from festering and keeps the team’s climate positive. **Best practice:** Establish as a norm that anyone can (and should) speak up if a team norm is violated, framing it as helping a teammate rather than punishing them. For example, instead of silent disapproval when someone is habitually late, a team with strong norms might agree to openly remind that person of the impact on others and ask if anything is needed to help them be on time. Research by Druskat and colleagues notes that having norms for **confronting problems with care** – such as using humor to defuse tension or openly acknowledging a member’s feelings – enables teams to correct issues before they damage trust[\[30\]](https://athena.ecs.csus.edu/~buckley/CSc192%20Web%20Files/HBR_Building_Emotional_Intelligence_of_Teams.pdf#:~:text=Inevitably%2C%20a%20team%20member%20will,day%20she%20selfishly%20decided%20to). By making feedback safe and routine, the team preserves emotional safety while upholding accountability.

Collectively, the norms in this first cluster create a foundation of **trust and inclusion**. Team members feel personally **known, respected, and supported**, which corresponds to the fundamental need for self-worth in a group[\[31\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,a%20sense%20of%20control%20in). Leaders who focus on this area help every individual feel that *“my team values me and wants me to succeed,”* a powerful driver of engagement. Notably, Druskat’s high-performing teams “listened more” and “acknowledged one another’s contributions” as part of their culture[\[32\]](https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/2025/07/unh-professors-book-shows-how-build-high-performing-teams#:~:text=teams%20with%20average%20teams%20doing,and%20acknowledged%20one%20another%27s%20contributions) – tangible signs of an environment where helping each other succeed is the norm.

### 2\. **“Learn and Advance Together” – How the Team Adapts and Grows**

The second cluster of Team EI norms centers on **continuous improvement, learning, and team self-management**. These norms ensure that the team doesn’t stagnate – they regularly examine how they operate and make adjustments in a psychologically safe way. Key norms and practices include:

* **Regular Team Reflection (Reviewing the Team):** High-performing teams build in routines to **step back periodically and evaluate** how they’re doing[\[33\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,When%20you%E2%80%99re%20reviewing%20the%20team). This might take the form of *retrospectives*, *after-action reviews*, or periodic “health check” meetings. Druskat found that the best self-managed teams *“constantly did”* this – in the absence of a single boss to evaluate them, they proactively asked, *“How are we doing? What can we do better?”*[\[33\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,When%20you%E2%80%99re%20reviewing%20the%20team). By normalizing collective reflection, teams surface problems early and involve everyone in solutions. **Best practice:** Schedule regular team retrospectives (e.g. monthly or at the end of each project phase) where the agenda is to openly discuss what’s working and what’s not. One case described by Druskat involved a struggling team implementing *monthly structured meetings* to candidly discuss team processes and brainstorm improvements[\[34\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=hindered%20collaboration). The result was a refocused effort on helping and learning from one another, restoration of the leader’s confidence in the team, and the team **outpacing its competitors within a year**[\[35\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=With%20the%20leader%E2%80%99s%20support%2C%20they,its%20competitors%20within%20the%20year). Such evidence underlines that a consistent norm of *self-review* can dramatically boost a team’s adaptability and outcomes.

* **Encouraging Open Expression (Psychological Safety):** For honest reflection to happen, team members must feel safe to speak their minds. Great teams therefore cultivate norms that **lower the hurdle for speaking truth** – making it easier for people to voice concerns, dissenting opinions, or new ideas without fear[\[36\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=Supportive%20expression%20is%20something%20that,second). Druskat added the concept of *“supportive expression”* to the model after observing that top teams find ways to support candor. For example, a team might use a round-robin format so everyone speaks in a review, or allow anonymous suggestions for sensitive topics. The goal is to ensure *everyone’s voice is heard*, addressing the fundamental need for influence in the team’s decisions[\[31\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,a%20sense%20of%20control%20in). Leaders play a crucial role here: by **modeling vulnerability and curiosity** (admitting their own mistakes, asking for input), a leader signals that it’s safe to take interpersonal risks. Psychological safety research shows that when leaders are approachable and inclusive, teams report higher safety and learning behavior[\[11\]](https://business.google.com/us/think/future-of-marketing/five-dynamics-effective-team/#:~:text=1,members%20reliably%20complete%20quality%20work)[\[37\]](https://business.google.com/us/think/future-of-marketing/five-dynamics-effective-team/#:~:text=,mistakes%20and%20exploring%20new%20ideas). **Tip:** Implement clear norms such as *“criticize the idea, not the person”* or *“disagreements are okay; silence is not”* to encourage constructive debate. Also, explicitly appreciate team members who speak up with tough feedback or questions – this reinforces that candor is valued. Over time, these practices create a climate where **critical (even heated) debate can occur without fear**, leading to better decisions and innovation[\[38\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=2,intelligent%20norms).

* **Building Optimism and an Affirmative Culture:** While honest discussions will surface problems, high-EI teams also make a conscious effort to **stay positive and future-focused** once issues are addressed. Druskat observed that effective teams, after reviewing their challenges, *“had a way to come around and be optimistic,”* saying in effect, *“We’re great, and here’s how we’ll succeed going forward,”* to *“create momentum.”*[\[39\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=to%20make%20it%20easier%20for,and%20getting%20information%20from%20stakeholders) This norm of optimism ensures that the team doesn’t get bogged down in negativity or blame. It boosts morale, resilience, and a shared belief that the team can overcome obstacles. **Best practice:** Balance every critical discussion with time spent recognizing achievements or envisioning solutions. For instance, after identifying several areas to improve, a team might round off the meeting by sharing a recent win or expressing confidence in the plan ahead. Research suggests that **teams need both “pessimistic” discussions (anticipating risks) and “optimistic” discussions (visualizing success)** to perform at their best[\[40\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=You%20need%20to%20develop%20norms,ability%20to%20achieve%20shared%20success). By engaging in proactive problem anticipation *and* hopeful goal-setting, teams satisfy members’ need for meaning and agency, keeping everyone motivated through tough challenges.

* **Proactive Problem-Solving and Learning (Being Strategic):** The final norm in this cluster involves looking ahead and outward to **anticipate issues before they escalate**. Teams with high EI don’t just react to problems – they jointly strategize about future threats or opportunities and take initiative to address them. Druskat notes that this often means gathering information from outside the team: *thinking in advance about what could go wrong gives members a sense of control, and often requires going out and getting information from stakeholders*[\[41\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=how%20we%E2%80%99re%20going%20to%20create,at%20the%20same%20level%20of). In practice, a team might conduct risk brainstorming sessions or invite feedback from other departments or customers to foresee hurdles. This norm ties to the need for *control* (having some influence over the team’s destiny)[\[31\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,a%20sense%20of%20control%20in) – by collectively managing risks and learning new skills, team members feel empowered rather than helpless. **Pragmatic approach:** Encourage the team to always ask, “What’s coming down the road and how can we prepare?” One technique is to create a simple *risk register* or *pre-mortem* analysis in team meetings. Another is to assign each team member an area to monitor (e.g. a salesperson watches market trends, an engineer tracks new technologies) so the team stays informed. This proactive mindset not only prevents surprises but also fuels continuous learning. In essence, teams that **build learning and adaptation into their everyday culture** are far more agile and resilient in the face of change[\[18\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=If%20there%20is%20a%20secret,into%20a%20team%E2%80%99s%20everyday%20culture).

By embracing these norms of continual learning and adaptation, a team becomes largely **self-managing**. Problems are identified and solved collectively, and the team continually fine-tunes its practices. Over time, this yields a strong sense of **collective efficacy** (“We can handle whatever comes our way”) and keeps the team aligned to its goals. It is worth noting that such norms can be a tough shift for leaders used to top-down control – it requires allowing the team to critique itself and even the leadership. However, the payoff is a team that *advances together* and shares responsibility for its performance. Studies indicate that when teams have regular reflexive sessions and high psychological safety, they demonstrate higher rates of process improvement and innovation[\[34\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=hindered%20collaboration)[\[37\]](https://business.google.com/us/think/future-of-marketing/five-dynamics-effective-team/#:~:text=,mistakes%20and%20exploring%20new%20ideas). Leaders should thus see their role not as micromanaging tasks, but as **facilitating an environment for ongoing team growth**.

### 3\. **“Engage Stakeholders” – How the Team Interfaces with Its Environment**

The third cluster of the TEI model extends beyond the team’s internal dynamics to how the team **manages its boundaries and relationships with external stakeholders**. Even self-managed teams operate within a larger organization or ecosystem, and their success often hinges on effectively **navigating the context** in which they work[\[42\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=really%20good%20with%20their%20stakeholders%2C,of%20not%20understanding%20their%20role)[\[43\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=often%20requires%20going%20out%20and,their%20teams%20mattered%20to%20them). Key norms here include:

* **Understanding the Team’s Context:** Emotionally intelligent teams encourage members to be aware of the bigger picture – the goals of the organization, the needs of customers, and the constraints or opportunities in their environment. Rather than operating in a vacuum, the team stays informed about external factors that impact its work. In Druskat’s research on self-managing production teams, the top performers went *“out of their way to understand what was going on up the hierarchy and around them”*[\[44\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,their%20teams%20mattered%20to%20them). This could mean keeping abreast of company strategy changes, market trends, or the priorities of senior leadership. **Best practice:** Dedicate time in meetings to discuss external updates (e.g., “market news” or “management updates” agenda items). Rotate the responsibility for bringing outside information to the team. When team members understand the context, they can align their efforts better and avoid surprises. This norm feeds into a sense of **purpose and impact** – team members see how their work fits into a larger mission, which is known to increase engagement and meaning[\[45\]](https://business.google.com/us/think/future-of-marketing/five-dynamics-effective-team/#:~:text=and%20key%20results%20,do%20%2054%20makes%20a).

* **Building External Relationships (“Stakeholder Engagement”):** High-EI teams actively cultivate **positive relationships with key stakeholders** such as senior managers, other teams, clients, or suppliers. Instead of waiting for help or direction, they reach out to build trust and mutual support outside the team. In Druskat’s model, stakeholder engagement was critical for self-managed teams to **maintain their autonomy** – teams that managed upward effectively could “hold on to their freedom” because their bosses trusted them and understood their needs[\[42\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=really%20good%20with%20their%20stakeholders%2C,of%20not%20understanding%20their%20role). *Engaging stakeholders* can take many forms as a best practice. One powerful approach Druskat cites is creating a **“stakeholder map”**: the team lists its important stakeholders and assigns each member to act as an *ambassador* to one of those stakeholders[\[46\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=One%20team%20we%20worked%20with,as%20an%20ambassador%20to%20each). By doing this, one team ensured regular communication and involvement of stakeholders in their process. The benefits were tangible: the information gathered helped the team think more strategically and even secure additional resources (e.g. a manufacturing team obtained new equipment; a pharma team got faster executive decisions)[\[47\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=and%20then%20assigned%20one%20team,as%20an%20ambassador%20to%20each). **Tip for leaders:** Encourage your team to proactively communicate progress and challenges to higher-ups and other departments. This might involve brief update emails, inviting stakeholders to certain meetings, or informal coffees to build rapport. Good external relationships act as a *buffer and support* – when a team hits a roadblock, having allies in other parts of the organization can expedite solutions (for instance, quickly getting approval or technical help). Moreover, these relationships help the team **gain external recognition** for its work, boosting team confidence and legitimacy.

* **Managing Up and Out (Boundary Spanning):** In emotionally intelligent teams, members recognize that *not all knowledge and resources reside within the team*. Thus, they adopt norms of **seeking outside expertise, feedback, and help** when needed. Druskat humorously notes that *“a team doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel if they talk to someone outside... to learn that the wheel exists.”*[\[48\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=pessimistic%20discussions). In practice, this norm might mean consulting other teams who’ve solved similar problems, or learning from customers’ insights, rather than operating in isolation. It also means being willing to **represent the team’s interests** to higher management – essentially, *managing up*. High-performing teams in Druskat’s studies often had members who skillfully influenced their bosses by providing data, setting expectations, and even educating the bosses on how best to support a self-directed team[\[49\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=really%20good%20with%20their%20stakeholders%2C,of%20not%20understanding%20their%20role)[\[50\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=often%20requires%20going%20out%20and,manage%20their%20teams%20mattered%20to). **Best practice:** Divide “boundary spanning” roles among team members – for example, one person liaises with the finance department for budget issues, another attends cross-team sync meetings, etc. Ensure the team has a norm like *“Don’t be afraid to ask for help or information from outside”*. By normalizing outreach, the team can plug knowledge gaps and secure needed resources quickly. This norm enhances innovation as well: teams that actively seek diverse input can combine ideas in novel ways, leading to more creative solutions.

The stakeholder engagement cluster of norms ensures the team is **well-connected and supported** in its endeavors. It prevents the team from becoming siloed or at odds with its environment. In fact, Druskat observed that the best teams were often *“really good with their stakeholders”* – they managed relationships so well that, when the team needed something, those external partners were eager to help[\[51\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=they%20were%20constantly%20learning%20from,of%20not%20understanding%20their%20role)[\[44\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,their%20teams%20mattered%20to%20them). This can be a decisive factor in long-term performance, especially in large organizations. It also ties back to the human need for *influence*: team members feel a greater sense of control and security when they know their team has allies and a voice in the broader system[\[31\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,a%20sense%20of%20control%20in). Leaders should note that supporting their team in stakeholder engagement might require **shielding the team from unnecessary interference** (acting as a buffer) while also **advocating for the team’s needs** at higher levels. When done well, engaging stakeholders not only helps the team achieve its goals but also sparks innovative thinking, as outside perspectives challenge the team to grow[\[52\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=5,innovative%20thinking%20within%20teams)[\[53\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=The%20information%20they%20obtained%20helped,quicker%20decisions%20from%20senior%20management).

### *Outcome: “Team Social Capital” – A Culture of Trust and High Performance*

When a team consistently practices norms in all three clusters – caring and supporting each other, continually learning and improving, and engaging stakeholders – it builds what Druskat calls **Team Social Capital**[\[54\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,teams%20to%20this%20high%20performance). This refers to the **reservoir of trust, psychological safety, team identity, and constructive dialogue** that the team accumulates over time[\[54\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,teams%20to%20this%20high%20performance). High team social capital is visible in how team members interact: you will see open exchanges of ideas, respectful debates, quick conflict resolution, and a strong unity around team goals. **Psychological safety** and **trust** mean members aren’t afraid to admit mistakes or ask for help; a strong **team identity** means they take pride in the team’s collective mission; and **constructive dialogue** means even tough conversations are handled in a positive, forward-moving way. All of these conditions directly correlate with superior team performance, as demonstrated in numerous studies[\[8\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%20neuroscience,their%20own%20fate%E2%80%94and%20the%20team%E2%80%99s)[\[37\]](https://business.google.com/us/think/future-of-marketing/five-dynamics-effective-team/#:~:text=,mistakes%20and%20exploring%20new%20ideas). In essence, the TEI model’s norms are the inputs, and **high performance and engagement are the outputs**. Teams that achieve this have an almost tangible “energy” and resilience – they perform at a high level and enable each member’s growth and satisfaction. Druskat’s work shows that such teams are not just happier; they deliver markedly better results, validating that **emotional intelligence at the team level is a powerful driver of organizational success**[\[4\]](https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/2025/07/unh-professors-book-shows-how-build-high-performing-teams#:~:text=The%20Team%20EI%20model%20took,and%20acknowledged%20one%20another%27s%20contributions)[\[55\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=Building%20high,%E2%80%9D).

## Best Practices for Building Team EI Norms

Implementing the TEI model in a real workplace requires deliberate action by leaders and team members. Below are **pragmatic best practices** aligned with the model’s clusters, grounded in both Druskat’s research and broader evidence. Managers and team leaders can use these as a checklist to **foster emotionally intelligent norms** in their teams:

1. **Articulate a Clear Team Purpose and Ensure Role Clarity:** Start by solidifying the team’s foundation. Work with the team to define an **engaging purpose** (why the team exists) and concrete goals. At the same time, clarify each member’s roles and responsibilities to avoid ambiguity[\[20\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,And%20what%20we). Google’s research emphasizes that having *structure and clarity* – knowing what’s expected and how each role contributes – is vital to team effectiveness[\[21\]](https://business.google.com/us/think/future-of-marketing/five-dynamics-effective-team/#:~:text=team%20effectiveness,personal%2C%20so%20it%20varies%20from). A clear purpose inspires commitment, and clear roles prevent conflict and confusion, creating the stable ground on which EI norms can flourish.

2. **Cultivate a Culture of Trust and Personal Understanding:** Invest time in team bonding and getting to know each other beyond work tasks. You can initiate regular “personal updates” in meetings, organize team lunches, or use icebreaker exercises where people share about their background, strengths, or work preferences. The goal is to humanize the team and build empathy. As Druskat’s research showed, **understanding teammates on a personal level is fundamental to trust**[\[22\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,that%20way%20than%20just%20giving). When members feel known and appreciated as individuals, they are more likely to trust one another and collaborate freely. *Action item:* Try a “user manual” exercise where each team member writes a one-pager on how they like to work and communicate – then discuss these in a session. This can rapidly increase mutual understanding.

3. **Set Norms for Respectful Communication and Feedback:** Make it explicit that the team values respect, and define what that looks like (e.g. active listening, no derogatory language, constructive criticism only). Importantly, **establish a norm that issues will be addressed openly and kindly** rather than swept under the rug. You might create a team charter that includes statements like “We speak up if someone’s behavior undermines the team, and we receive feedback with an open mind.” Druskat’s high-performing teams had zero tolerance for disrespect – they confronted problematic behavior, but in ways that maintained dignity and relationship[\[28\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20fundamental%20to%20building%20safety,just%20created%20negativity%20in%20the)[\[26\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=team,another%2C%20and%20that%20builds%20belonging). If you are a leader, demonstrate this norm by intervening when you see toxic behavior (e.g. sarcasm, blame) and coaching the team on better communication. Over time, team members themselves will start “calling the foul” constructively when needed[\[29\]](https://athena.ecs.csus.edu/~buckley/CSc192%20Web%20Files/HBR_Building_Emotional_Intelligence_of_Teams.pdf#:~:text=Inevitably%2C%20a%20team%20member%20will,day%20she%20selfishly%20decided%20to), which keeps the team environment healthy and positive.

4. **Institute Regular Team “Retrospectives” or Check-ins:** Don’t wait for annual reviews or crises to evaluate the team’s functioning. Schedule frequent reflection sessions specifically about **how the team is working** (separate from project updates). In these sessions, pose questions like: *What are we doing well as a team? What could we do better? Are our norms being followed, or do we need to adjust how we operate?* Ensure everyone has a chance to speak. Druskat notes that **periodic team reviews were a hallmark of great teams** – it allowed them to self-correct and improve continuously[\[33\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,When%20you%E2%80%99re%20reviewing%20the%20team). To keep this practice effective, make the atmosphere blameless and focus on future solutions. Some teams use formats like “Start/Stop/Continue” or “Glad/Sad/Mad” to structure the conversation. Leaders should facilitate these meetings initially, but ideally rotate the facilitator role among members to reinforce shared ownership of team process. Regular retrospectives build a norm that *the team is always learning*, which keeps it adaptive and cohesive.

5. **Encourage Open Dialogue and Psychological Safety:** Psychological safety doesn’t happen by accident – you need to nurture it. **Invite input and questions** actively, and respond appreciatively when team members speak up, especially with dissenting opinions or bad news. Never punish or ridicule someone for voicing a concern. As a leader, you can set the tone by saying things like, “I might be missing something – does anyone see it differently?” and by thanking those who challenge ideas. Small practices like round-table discussions (where each person speaks in turn) or anonymous Q\&A channels can also help quieter voices be heard. Remember that **everyone’s voice matters for team EI**[\[31\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,a%20sense%20of%20control%20in). Druskat’s work ties a *voice in how the team operates* to members’ feeling of belonging and commitment. From a pragmatic standpoint, teams might adopt a rule that *decisions are not finalized until we’ve heard from each team member*, or use tools like anonymous surveys to surface issues people might hesitate to bring up. The payoff is huge: higher psychological safety leads to more learning and fewer errors[\[11\]](https://business.google.com/us/think/future-of-marketing/five-dynamics-effective-team/#:~:text=1,members%20reliably%20complete%20quality%20work)[\[37\]](https://business.google.com/us/think/future-of-marketing/five-dynamics-effective-team/#:~:text=,mistakes%20and%20exploring%20new%20ideas), as team members won’t hide problems but solve them together.

6. **Balance Critique with Optimism:** When tackling problems or giving feedback, make sure to also highlight positives and express confidence in the team’s ability to improve. This balance prevents “problem discussions” from demoralizing the team. For example, if a project went wrong, discuss what can be learned (critique) *and* acknowledge what still went right or how this will help the team grow (optimism). Druskat observed that **great teams intentionally built optimism after difficult conversations to maintain morale**[\[39\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=to%20make%20it%20easier%20for,and%20getting%20information%20from%20stakeholders). Leaders can normalize this by ending meetings on an upbeat note – e.g., “Let’s each share one thing we’re looking forward to or one recent success.” Encouraging optimism isn’t about being Pollyanna; it’s about reinforcing *collective efficacy*. In fact, research suggests teams that believe in their capability tend to perform better, a concept known as team efficacy. An optimistic outlook fuels persistence and creativity, turning setbacks into stepping stones. Make hope and confidence a self-fulfilling norm in your team culture.

7. **Plan and Problem-Solve Proactively:** Don’t let the team fall into a purely reactive mode. Introduce practices for **anticipating challenges and being strategic**. For instance, use a portion of planning meetings to ask “What could go wrong in this next quarter, and how would we respond?” By doing this, you not only generate contingency plans but also give the team a sense of control and preparedness. Druskat includes *proactive problem-solving* as a key norm – teams that think ahead together feel more mastery over their fate[\[41\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=how%20we%E2%80%99re%20going%20to%20create,at%20the%20same%20level%20of). You can also encourage team members to proactively identify opportunities for improvement (not just problems). Perhaps start a “continuous improvement log” or have team members take turns researching new ideas or tools to bring to the group. Such forward-looking norms embed a growth mindset in the team. As an added benefit, this norm often requires reaching beyond the team for information (connecting to stakeholders or experts), which dovetails with the next practice.

8. **Map Your Stakeholders and Engage Them Regularly:** A very practical step is to create a simple **stakeholder map**. List out who has a stake in the team’s success – e.g., upper management, other departments, key clients, end-users, etc. Assign a team member to each stakeholder (or group of stakeholders) as a point of contact. This person should periodically check in with their assigned stakeholder, keep them informed, gather input, and report back to the team. As noted earlier, one team that did this found it sharpened their strategic thinking and even yielded direct support (like new equipment) from management[\[46\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=One%20team%20we%20worked%20with,as%20an%20ambassador%20to%20each). By making stakeholder engagement an ongoing team norm, you ensure the team is never blindsided by changing expectations and can rally support when needed. It also spreads the work of relationship-building across the team rather than over-relying on the formal leader. **In practice:** have team members give brief updates on their stakeholder conversations during team meetings. Recognize and thank members for building those external bridges. Over time, your team will gain a reputation for collaboration and foresight, which only attracts more support and trust from the rest of the organization.

9. **“Manage Up” with Transparency and Alignment:** Especially for self-managing or empowered teams, it’s crucial to manage the relationship with bosses or higher leadership. Best practice here is **regular, transparent communication upward** – don’t wait for your boss to ask for a status report. Proactively share your team’s goals, progress, and any needs or concerns. By doing so, you shape the narrative about your team and build trust. Druskat found that self-managed teams preserved their autonomy by educating their external leaders and clarifying how those leaders could help (rather than interfere)[\[49\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=really%20good%20with%20their%20stakeholders%2C,of%20not%20understanding%20their%20role). For instance, invite your manager to a team meeting occasionally to witness the team’s norms in action, or send a monthly summary highlighting both achievements and challenges. This openness can preempt any loss of confidence and prevent a micromanagement response. Moreover, align your team’s objectives with the broader goals of the organization and make that explicit: show higher-ups that the team is focused on what matters to the business. When leaders see a team is responsible and aligned, they are more likely to grant latitude and resources. In short, by **actively managing up,** the team gains external trust and freedom to self-organize.

10. **Measure and Reinforce the Norms:** To ensure the EI norms stick, consider using **assessments or feedback tools**. Vanessa Druskat herself employs a Team EI Survey to help teams pinpoint which norms are strong and which are lacking[\[56\]](https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/2025/07/unh-professors-book-shows-how-build-high-performing-teams#:~:text=With%20teams%20like%20this%2C%20Druskat,culture%20of%20trust%20and%20collaboration). Leaders can adapt this idea in a simple way: every few months, ask team members to rate or discuss how well the team is living up to its norms (e.g., “On a scale of 1-5, how safe do you feel speaking up in our team?” or “Are we addressing issues promptly or letting things fester?”). Use the insights to celebrate successes (e.g., “Great, everyone feels heard in meetings\!”) and to address gaps (“It seems we’re slipping on starting meetings on time, how can we improve that?”). This meta-conversation about norms keeps them front and center. It also signals that **team culture is a collective responsibility**, not something to be taken for granted. Additionally, reinforcing norms can be as straightforward as **recognizing and rewarding behaviors that exemplify them**. For example, acknowledge a team member who diplomatically resolved a conflict (reinforcing constructive feedback norm) or someone who brought valuable outside information to the group (reinforcing stakeholder engagement norm). Such recognition, whether public praise or a small reward, can motivate others to follow suit and cement the desired behaviors.

By systematically applying these best practices, leaders and teams will gradually see a transformation in their climate. Initially, it may feel like a lot of “process,” but these practices eventually become second nature **habits of an emotionally intelligent team**. The scientific rigor behind them – from Google’s data on effective teams to academic studies on team EI – should give leaders confidence that this is not just management folklore, but a proven path to performance. As one Fortune 100 team leader succinctly put it, *“No one on my team has A+ skills, but we collaborate in ways that produce A+ work.”*[\[55\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=Building%20high,%E2%80%9D). **Emotionally intelligent norms are the key to unlocking that level of collaboration**. They enable teams to harness the full potential of each member, resulting in outcomes greater than the sum of their parts.

## Conclusion

In today’s complex and fast-changing work environment, technical expertise and individual intelligence alone are not enough to guarantee team success. **Emotional intelligence at the team level – embodied in supportive, learning-focused, and externally aware norms – is the differentiator between average teams and outstanding ones.** Vanessa Druskat’s Team EI model gives leaders a scientifically grounded blueprint for developing a high-performance team culture. By focusing on how team members **connect, communicate, and collectively self-regulate**, managers can create conditions of trust and psychological safety where collaboration thrives. We have reviewed each aspect of this model, from treating one another with understanding and respect, to continuously learning as a team, to actively engaging with stakeholders. Across these dimensions, we see a common thread: fulfilling core human needs (to be valued, to have a voice, to have influence) fuels positive emotions and behaviors that drive team success[\[8\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%20neuroscience,their%20own%20fate%E2%80%94and%20the%20team%E2%80%99s)[\[31\]](https://humanfirstworks.com/team-emotional-intelligence-and-higher-performance-vanessa-druskat-2/#:~:text=,a%20sense%20of%20control%20in).

For leaders seeking practical methods, the message is clear. **Be intentional in crafting your team’s norms** – don’t leave team culture to chance. Use the best practices outlined (like team charters, regular retrospectives, stakeholder mapping, etc.) to reinforce the norms of emotional intelligence. Over time, your team will accumulate a strong *social capital*: a feeling of safety, unity, and shared purpose that enables superior performance. The research evidence is compelling: teams that invest in emotional intelligence **consistently outperform those that don’t**, often by significant margins[\[4\]](https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/2025/07/unh-professors-book-shows-how-build-high-performing-teams#:~:text=The%20Team%20EI%20model%20took,and%20acknowledged%20one%20another%27s%20contributions)[\[14\]](https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/276291#:~:text=between%20six%20emotionally%20intelligent%20team,Keywords%3A%20teams%2C%20effectiveness%2C%20emotional%20intelligence). Equally important, they create a healthier, more engaging work experience for their members, leading to lower turnover and higher well-being[\[7\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%20neuroscience,their%20own%20fate%E2%80%94and%20the%20team%E2%80%99s)[\[57\]](https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/2025/07/unh-professors-book-shows-how-build-high-performing-teams#:~:text=Despite%20their%20intelligence%20and%20experience%2C,and%20emotional%20safety%2C%20Druskat%20says).

In summary, the TEI model is both pragmatic and scientific – it translates psychology research into actionable norms any team can adopt. By helping teams to “help one another succeed,” “learn and advance together,” and “engage stakeholders,” leaders can unleash the *collective emotional intelligence* that turns a group of talented individuals into a **cohesive, high-performing team**. Embracing these principles offers a path to not only better results, but also a more human-centered way of working where everyone thrives together. As the data and examples show, **the effort to build an emotionally intelligent team is well worth it – it is the engine that drives trust, innovation, and excellence in today’s organizations**[\[55\]](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/build-emotionally-intelligent-teams-bookbite/56409/?srsltid=AfmBOorVU__cj5Pc8LdjyeyK7HIuLcVsCa9LccVbTtFwabESuWXg249a#:~:text=Building%20high,%E2%80%9D)[\[6\]](https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/2025/07/unh-professors-book-shows-how-build-high-performing-teams#:~:text=,performing%20teams.%E2%80%9D).
